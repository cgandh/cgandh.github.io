A badge maybe. Abaft there! A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel. A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a paper shuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. A bargain. A barren land, bare waste. A basilisk. A batch knelt at the altarrails. A bat flew. A baton cool protruding. Abbas father, furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains? Abbey Theatre! —A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. A BELLHANGER: A classic face! A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck. A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. A BIDDER: A florin. A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking. A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl. A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. A bit at a time. A bit nervy. A bit off the top. A bit sprung. A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. A black skullcap descends upon his head. A BLACKSMITH: Murmurs. A blade of grass, shell of her hands, then blow. A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. A., B. L., Mus. A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY: Bravo! Abnegation? Aboard of the Bugabu. A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive. A boat would be near, a lifebuoy. A bogoak frame over his bald head: Wilde’s Requiescat. A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me. A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. —About a fortnight ago, sir? About a million barrels all the same. About biscuits he dimly remembered. About her windraw face hair trailed. About his head writhe eels and elvers. About noon. About six hundred per cent profit. About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. —About the boatman? About the nature of women he read in Michelet. About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside. About us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets. Above sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head watched and admired. A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting. A boy. A bridge is across a river. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. Abroad? A brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella. Absence makes the heart grow younger. Absence of body. A. B. S.
 In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document. Absinthe. Absinthe for me, savvy? Absinthe the lot. Absolutely! Absolutely. Absolutely it. Absurd! Absurd. Absurd I am. Abulafia! A burly rough pursues with booted strides. A buxom lassy. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume. A call again. A cannonshot. A canting jay and a rheumeyed curdog is all their progeny. A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom’s hat. A cardinal’s son. A card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street. A card Unfurnished Apartments slipped from the sash and fell. A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching. A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. A cave. Accep my poor litt pres enclos. Accepting the analogy implied in his guest’s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce? Accept my little pres. Accept my little present. Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s. Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion who ought not perchance to express one was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on accordingly. Accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly. Account for yourself this very sminute or woe betide you! Accusations are made in anger. —A cenar teco. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance. A chain of children ’s hands imprisons him. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. A cheese sandwich, then. A child. —A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina. A child bit by a bellows! A child Conmee saved from pandies. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy. A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar’s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat. A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Vincent O’Brien, sings the chorus from Handel’s Messiah Alleluia for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly. A chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew a voice away. A cigarette appears on the table. A circle. A clack. A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green. A coat of liver of sulphur. A cockhorse to Banbury cross. A coffin bumped out on to the road. A coin gleams on her forehead. A cold seawind blows from his druid mouth. A COLLISION ENSUES
 The bell whirred again as he rang off. A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady’s black straw hat. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable. A contract with an inconsiderate contractee for the delivery of 32 consignments of some given commodity in consideration of cash payment on delivery per delivery at the initial rate of 1/4d to be increased constantly in the geometrical progression of 2 1/4d, 1/2d, 1d, 2d, 4d, 8d, 1s 4d, 2s 8d to 32 terms. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. A cork and bottle. A corpse is meat gone bad. A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward. A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up. A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone. A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm. A counterjumper’s son. A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality, of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown. Acoustics that is. A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks. A crazy queen, old and jealous. A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. A creamfruit melon he held to me. A crone standing by with a smoky oillamp rams her last bottle in the maw of his sack. A croppy boy. Across his loins is slung a pilgrim’s wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun’s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. Across the world for a wife. A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins surges forward. Act. Act speech. A curse is on it. Acushla machree! A darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker’s cart. A darkbacked figure under Merchants’ arch scanned books on the hawker’s cart. A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs. A dark horse. A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure. A DARKVISAGED MAN: In disguised accent. A DAYFATHER
 He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed, spectacled, aproned. Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz. coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope lately. Addio, caro. Address. Address: Barclay and Cook, 18 Talbot street. A DEADHAND: Writes on the wall. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. A dead snip. A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms. A deafmute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus’ dance. —A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there. A defect is ten times worse in a woman. A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle. Adhuc. A diner, knife and fork upright, elbows on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the foodlift across his stained square of newspaper. A discussion is difficult down here. —A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all our misfortunes. A DISTANT VOICE
—I’ll answer it, the professor said, going. —Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini. A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups. Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties. Admiring. A dog barks in the distance. A dog’s spittle as you probably... Adonai! ADONAI: Dooooooooooog! ADONAI: Goooooooooood! A door on the return landing is flung open. Adorer of the adulterous rump! A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously. A downpour we want not your drizzle. A dream of wellfilled hose. A drenching of that violence, he tells me, sans blague, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. A drowning man. A drunken navvy grips with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. A dry rush. A Dublin fusilier was in that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. A dull ease of the mind. A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands. A dwarf’s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy’s was. A dying scrawl. A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness. A.E.I.O.U.
—Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries? A. E. Rumpled stockings. A. E.: what does that mean? A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman, O’Rourke, prince of Breffni. A false priest’s servant bade him welcome. Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness. —A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary evil. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. A fellow that’s neither fish nor flesh. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One. A FEMALE INFANT: Shakes a rattle. A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. A FEMINIST: Masculinely. A fence more likely. A few bob a skull. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter, puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity. A few pastilles of aconite. A few wellchosen words. —A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery, recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling:
—Night! A fine carriage she had. A firm heelclacking tread is heard on the stairs. A flasher? A flower. A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan’s cheek. A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat snores, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. —Afraid he’ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering. —Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the chookchooks. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Afraid to pass a remark on him. A French Celt said that. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. A friend of mine sent me. A friend of my father’s, is it? A frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew came glazily in the day along the quay towards Mr Bloom. After. After? After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him flat. After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. —After all, Haines began... After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. —After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world. —After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. After all there’s a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from the earth garlic of course it stinks after Italian organgrinders crisp of onions mushrooms truffles. After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and
—That must have been highly diverting, said he. After a silence Cochrane said:
—What is it, sir? After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. After dinner on a Sunday. Aftereffect not pleasant. After getting better asleep with Molly. After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home. After God Shakespeare has created most. After having said which I took my departure. After he’ll see. After her. After he woke me last night same dream or was it? After him! After him, boy!

After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. After life’s journey. After liquids came solids. Afternoon. Afternoon she said. After one. —After, Stephen said. After supper walk a mile. After that, of course
... After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their belts. After them march gentlemen of the bedchamber, Black Rod, Deputy Garter, Gold Stick, the master of horse, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen’s iron crown, the chalice and bible. After them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopers, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimneysweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertakers, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion brokers, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it. —After three, he said. After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. After two. After which harrowing dénouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket. After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him. Afterwit. After with Dedalus’ son. —Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly. After you is good manners. —After you, Mr Bloom said. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. —After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry. Again. Again. Again. Again. Again! Again! Again: a goal. Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair cf earwashing cat. Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:
—O greasy eyes! —Again, sir. Against John Long’s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Against my grain somehow. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. Against the wall. A gallant scene in truth it made. A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace descende!, clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Age has not withered it. Agenbite. Agenbite. Agenbite of inwit. Agenbite of inwit. Agenbite of inwit. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience. Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa. Agendath Netaim. Agendath Netaim: planters’ company. Agendath what is it? A general rush and scramble. A ghoststory. —A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one. A gift to his guest of one of the four lady’s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition. A girl. A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. A gnawing sorrow is there all the time. A goat. A good layer. A goodlooking sovereign. A good thought, boy, to come. —A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added. A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e. A great poet on a great brother poet. A Greek he was. A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen’s heart. A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood. A gruesome case. A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. A guinea, I mean. Ah! Ah. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Aha. Aha! Aha! Aha. —Aha... Aha! Aha! A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. A hackney car, number three hundred and twentyfour, driver Barton James of number one Harmony avenue, Donnybrook, on which sat a fare, a young gentleman, stylishly dressed in an indigoblue serge suit made by George Robert Mesias, tailor and cutter, of number five Eden quay, and wearing a straw hat very dressy, bought of John Plasto of number one Great Brunswick street, hatter. A hackneycar, number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. —Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A HAG: What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence. Ah, alluring. Aham! Aham! A Handbook of Astronomy cover, brown leather, detached, 5 plates, antique letterpress long primer, author’s footnotes nonpareil, marginal clues brevier, captions small pica. A hand glides over his left thigh. A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords. —A hard one, sir. A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Ahasuerus I call him. A hater of his kind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars. A haughty bronze replied:
—I’ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence. Aha, yes. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou. Ah, bloody nonsense. Ah, bosh, man. Ah, curse you! Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! A headland, a ship, a sail upon the billows. A heavy fume gushed in answer. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid. A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between. —Ahem! he said very softly. A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life. —Ah, gelong with your great times coming. —Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man. —Ah, go to God! Ahhkkk! —Ah, I couldn’t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless. Ah, I’m hungry. —Ah, listen to this for God’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. Ah, lure! Ah, Martha! Ah, naughty, naughty! Ah no, that’s the soap. Ah, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Aho! A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. A hoarse virago retorts. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness. A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely... A HOLLYBUSH: And in the devil’s glen? A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier, or good mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard? A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son. A housekeeper of one of those fellows if you could pick it out of her. Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down. Ah, poor dogsbody! —Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. Ah, see now! Ah soap there I yes. —Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Ah, sure we were too. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Ah, the brigade, of course. Ah, the brother-in-law. Ah, the names. —Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh. Ah, the soap I put there. Ah, to be sure! A hundred thousand apologies. A Hungarian it was one day... A husky fifenote blew. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed. —Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. —Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Ah, what M’Guckin! Ah, yes. Ah, yes. Ah, yes. Ah, yes! Ah yes. Ah, yes. Ah, yes! Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open. Ah yes! of course. Ah yes, the last time. Ah, you mean it’s after twelve! —Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn. Ah, you weren’t there. Aids to digestion. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door. Aims. Air! Air of the place maybe. Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs. A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master’s praise. A jet of coffee steam from the burnished caldron. A jolt. A juicy pear or ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet. A jumping rose on satiny breast of satin, rose of Castile. A just and homely word. Ak! Akasic records. Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was. A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. A kind of a bridge. A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin. Alacrity she served. A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands. A lamp. A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás Meadow of Murmuring Waters. A large bucket. A large moist stain appears on her robe. Alarmed face asks me. Alas! —Alas, Stephen said. Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud. A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer’s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars. A laugh tripped over his lips. Albert Edward, Arthur Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire. Alderman Robert O’Reilly emptying the port into his soup before the flag fell. —A learner rather, Stephen said. Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one. Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Roschaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith. A letter. —A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. Alexander J Christ Dowie, that’s my name, that’s yanked to glory most half this planet from Frisco beach to Vladivostok. ALEXANDER J DOWIE: Violently. Alexander J. Keyes. Alexander Keyes. Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. ALEXANDER KEYES: When will we have our own house of keys? A lex eterna stays about Him. ALF BERGAN: Points jeering at the sandwichboards. Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. Alice will feel the pullpull. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. A lifetime in a night. A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes. A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool. A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands. A liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly, hearing. A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged. A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies’ cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs for they love crushes, instinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice, even a pricelist of their hosiery. A little time. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. A livre! cries Monsieur Lynch. All. All. All a bit touched. All against us. All agree with him. All a kind of attempt to talk. All a prejudice. All are. All are washed in the blood of the lamb. All are washed in the blood of the sun. All balls! All breadcrumbs they are. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum. All butting with their skulls to get out of it. All changed. All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants. All clapped. All comely virgins. All cordially invited. All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. All crossed themselves and stood up. All days make their end. All dead names. All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. All dimpled cheeks and curls,
     Your head it simply swirls. All ears. Allee samee dis bunch. Alleluia. Alleluia. All’erta! All events brought grist to his mill. All fades. All fallen. All fallen. Allfather, the heavenly man. All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy virtuous or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. All flushed O!, panting, sweating O!, all breathless. All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants there must have been quite a score of them outside some primitive shanties of osier. All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. All for a shadow. All for a woman, home and houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. All for number one. All for number one. All for number one. All gnawed through. ALL: God save Leopold the First! All gone. All heartily welcome. All hearts were beating. All he might have done. All his alabaster lilypots. All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus says. All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong cells. All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God. All I can give you I give. Allimportant question. All in all. All in if he spots me. All insanity. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles. —All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf. All Ireland versus one! All Irish. All is lost now. —All is lost now. All is lost now. All is lost now! All is not well. All I want is a little time. All join heartily in the singing. All kinds of crazy longings. All kinds of places are good for ads. All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his B’s busy brain, education the genuine article, literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it, and a slice of luck. All kings’ sons. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas, creaking beds. All laughed. All looked. All lost in pity for croppy. All lost now. All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing. All most too new call is lost in all. All music when you come to think. All must go through it, Stephen. All my babies, she said. All now? All off for a buster, armstrong, hollering down the street. All off for a drink. —All on the baker’s list, Mrs Breen said. All or not at all. All our habits. All ousted looked. All over. Allow me. Allow me. Allow me to introduce my. All parks open to the public day and night. All poppycock, you’ll scuse me saying. All possess bachelor’s button discovered by Rualdus Columbus. All prick and no pence. All quiet on Howth now. All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats. All raised untidy caps. All recedes. All right, sir. All right till I come back anyhow. All serene. All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God’s rightwiseness to withsay. All sides of life should be represented. All skedaddled. All smiled their smiles. All soil like that without dung. All songs on that theme. All souls’ day. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising. All tarred with the same brush. All that are in favour say ay, Lenehan announced. All that for nothing. All that Italian florid music is. All that long business about that brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage alleluia. All that man has seen! All that old hill has seen. All that’s left of him. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped. All that the hand says when you touch. All the beef to the heels were in. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. All the dirty things I made her say. —All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. —All the leading provincial... All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. All the octuplets are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. All the odd things people pick up for food. All the people are looking at you. All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys. All the same Bloom properly so dubbed was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years. All the same he must have been a bit of a natural not to see it was a yeoman cap. All these here once walked round Dublin. —All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his shadow. All these rocks with lines and scars and letters. —All the talents, Myles Crawford said. All the toady news. All the way from Gibraltar. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. All things end. All this I promise to do. All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats. All those holes and pebbles. All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York. All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan’s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killed her first. All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop. —All too Irish, Stephen rejoined. All to see. All trio laughed. All trotting down with porringers and tommycans to be filled. All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. All turned where they stood. Allude to it. Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:
—He is down on his luck. All uncovered again for a few instants. All uncover their heads. All up a plumtree. Alluring. All waited. All waited. All walked after. All want to be on good terms with him. All was lost now. All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers. All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own. All we laughed. ALL: What? All wheel whirl waltz twirl. All who wish you well hope this for you. All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. All wrong of course. All yielding she tossed my hair. All you meant to me then. Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework. Almidano Artifoni said. Almidano Artifoni said. Almidano Artifoni said. 
 Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell’s yard. Almonds or. Almost certain. Almost human the way it sllt to call attention. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white. Almost taste them by looking. Alo! Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. Alone. Alone, what did Bloom feel? Alone, what did Bloom hear? A long and seafed silent rut. Along an infinite invisible tightrope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a twoheaded octopus in gillie’s kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the form of the Three Legs of Man. Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it. A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church’s looms. Along the route the regiments of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the King’s own Scottish Borderers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. A look around. A lore of drugs. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. A lot of money he spent colouring it. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her. A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured: all. Also a shop often noticed. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Also hearses. Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness. Also I think I. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing. Also me. Also now. Also poor papa went away. Also ran: J de Bremond’s French horse Bantam Lyons was anxiously inquiring after not in yet but expected any minute Maximum II. Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure. Also that now is magnetism. Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed. Also the day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin’s King picked it up in the wake fifty yards astern. Also the form, the figure. Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. Also the library today: those girl graduates. Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen. Also to me. Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing. Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. Although the former we are thinking of neglect is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery. Always a good word to say. Always at home at dinnertime. Always find out this equal to that. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Always happening like that. Always have fresh greens then. Always in front of us. Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Always liked to let her self out. Always off to a fellow when they are. Always open sesame. Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all. Always see a fellow’s weak point in his wife. Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. Always talking shop. Always the same, year after year. Always want to be swilling in company. Always warm from her. A lyrical tenor if you like. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is who was just the usual everyday farewell, my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate and inflammable doubtless the fallen leader, that is, not the other in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass’s kick. A make, mister. A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Am all them and the same now we? A man. A man and his menfriends are living there in clover. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trapdoor. A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an ape’s gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar, his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. A man of genius makes no mistakes. A MAN OF HIGH MORALE
—Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O’Molloy said to Stephen. AM. A.
 No room. A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting. A MAN: Rising from his knees. A man’s a man for a’ that. A man spitting back on his plate: halfmasticated gristle: gums: no teeth to chewchewchew it. A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf. A man with an infant’s saucestained napkin tucked round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. A married man! A mason, yes. Ambidexterity is also latent. A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards. Amen. Amen! Amen. Amen. Amen! Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. —Amen, says the citizen. —Amen! was responded from the doorway. —A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not? America, I said quietly, just like that. American soap I bought: elderflower. Am I a father? —Am I awfully sunburnt? Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight. Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company. A mighthavebeen. Am I going to aunt Sara’s or not? Am I like that? A MILLIONAIRESS: Richly. A million pounds, wait a moment. Am I not going there? Am I not right? Am I right? —Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions. A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool. A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney, I remember. A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled his brain. Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand? Amn’t I with you? Amn’t I your girl? A moment! A moment and all is over. A Monday morning, ’twas so, indeed. Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide. Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! A moonlit nightcall: far, far. A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first. Amor matris: subjective and objective genitive. Amor matris, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true thing in life. Amor me solo! A mormon. Amoroso ma non troppo. Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus
... A most instructive discussion. A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O’Ciarnain’s in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. A mother watches me from her doorway. A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades. A mourning coach. Amours of actresses. A mouthful of tea. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings the mermaids’ with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks passim. Amplius. Amplius. A multitude of midges swarms white over his robe. A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation for he swore a round hand that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath. Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:
—A pleased bottom. —A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. An acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell’s wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever.... An afterclang of Cowley’s chords closed, died on the air made richer. Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. An ambition to squint
     At my verses in print
     Makes me hope that for these you’ll find room. An ancient haggadah book in which a pair of hornrimmed convex spectacles inserted marked the passage of thanksgiving in the ritual prayers for Pessach Passover: a photocard of the Queen’s Hotel, Ennis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed: To My Dear Son Leopold. An animated altercation in which all took part ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland’s patron saint. AN APPLEWOMAN: He’s a man like Ireland wants. An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation: a silent contemplation. Anarchist. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. A nation is the same people living in the same place. —A nation? says Bloom. An attendant from the doorway called:
—Mr Lyster! An awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business. An azured harebell like her veins. —Anch’io ho avuto di queste idee, Almidano Artifoni said, quand’ ero giovine come Lei. Ancient free and accepted order. —And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen. And Able was I ere I saw Elba. And a call, pure, long and throbbing. And after? —And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like the next fellow? And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S.

Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And after: thinking alone. And a game filly she is. And a good armful she was. And a houseful of kids at home. And a letter for you. And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word. And all down the form. And all the people shall say, Amen. And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a slut shouts out of her:
—Eh, mister! And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair. And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. And America they say is the land of the free. And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy’s terrace. And and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si? And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. And a pound and a half of Denny’s sausages. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whore’s shoulders. And apropos of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings. And a pull all together. And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he B. couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. —And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s dead? And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God’s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly:
—What is the matter? And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness. And assaulted my chum. And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being. And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth. And as they wended their way by Nelson’s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge, illuminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de Saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? —And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs. And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy. And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said. And baby prattled after her:
—A jink a jink a jawbo. —And Bass’s mare? says Terry. And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up. And been to barber he have. And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:
—Three cheers for Israel! And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again. And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. And Belfast. And better. And blind too, poor fellow. And Bloom? And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:
—Now, don’t you think, Bergan? And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. And Bloom with his but don’t you see? and but on the other hand. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there. And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well. And butter for fish. And buy from us. And by Japers I had no wedding garment. And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun. And by the door deaf Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her. And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks. And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib. —And Corny Kelleher himself? And deepmoved all, Simon trumping compassion from foghorn nose, all laughing they brought him forth, Ben Dollard, in right good cheer. And did you chachachachacha? And distant hills seem coming nigh. And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you may it be the distant day! and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest. And done! And don’t they rake in the money too? And don’t you smash that piano. And do you know why? And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers. And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores. And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station. And ever shall be. And everybody knows that it’s the very opposite of that that is really life. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he’s a father or a mother. And, faith, he filled up. And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. And Father Cowley laughed again. And flushed yet more you horrid!, more goldenly. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it. —And four. And free our native land. And from her arms. And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. And gold flushed more. —And Harry of six wives’ daughter. —And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. And he, a bachelor, how... And he after stuffing himself till he’s fit to burst. And He answered with a main cry: Abba! And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. And heartrending scenes. And he came fifth and lost the job. And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion. And he doubled up. And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car. And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street. And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case. And he insulted us. And he interfered twict with my clothing. And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:
—Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum. And he let a volley of oaths after him. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? —And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly. And here crowns. —And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint. —And here’s himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. And here what will you learn more? And her hair is dyed gold and he... And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home. And her name is Ursula. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan’s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings. And her take me to rests and her anker of rum. And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kilbride, the enginedriver, and lancecorporal Oliphant. And he said: Another victory like that and we are done for. And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there. —And he said: Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile. And he sat him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And he’s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam. And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And he shouting to the bloody dog:
—After him, Garry! And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ. And he started laughing. And he starts reading out one. And he starts reading them out:
—Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne’s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:
—A most scandalous thing! And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. And he took the last swig out of the pint. And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first. And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the Kilkenny People. And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull. And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope. And his ark was open. And his Dulcinea? And his first child a girl? And his name? And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. And how I am punished! —And how is Dick, the solid man? —And how is that basso profondo, Benjamin? And how’s the old heart, citizen? says he. And humanely his driver waited till he or she had ended, patient in his scythed car. —And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. And if he was alive all the time? And, if I don’t greatly mistake she was Spanish too. And if it were your own son in Oxford? —And if not? he said. —And I from thee... And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest. And I’ll write to you. —And I’m sure He will, says Joe. And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek. And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure. And in black. And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven. And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this time stretched over. And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment. And in the porches of mine ear did pour. And in the porches of their ears I pour. And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field. And I schschschschschsch. —And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses. —And is he doing for the Freeman? And is that Bloom? And it can be cured. And it is rather long to tell. And it left him wondering why. And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone. —And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. And it’s extremely curious the smell. And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin-the-Goat. AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER
 He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type. And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word. And Joe asked him would he have another. And just imagine that. And just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal. And just when he and she. —And kicking. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O’Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed Bloom did, without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s character, no pun intended. —And leave it to my hands, she said. And left the femme de trente ans. And let our crooked smokes. And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race. —And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life. And look at the lovely shell she brought. And look at this blasted rag, says he. And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O’Molloy’s, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty’s counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert. And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin. —And Madam Bloom, Mr O’Madden Burke added. And Madame. —And Madame, Mr Power said smiling. —And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And Mastiansky with the old cither. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul. And me now. And me with a soldier friend. And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher’s lunch basket. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O’Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across... And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I’ll lay you what you like she did it on purpose... And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist. —And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven. And Mr? And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable. And Mr Sheehy himself? And my turn? And my wife has the typhoid. And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing. And Noah was drunk with wine. And no more turn aside and brood. And no more turn aside and brood. And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy. And now? And now he’ll play his ball no more
     For he lies among the dead. —And now he’s going round to Mr Menton’s office. And now his strongroom for the gold. And now it was an office or something. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir. And now, why? And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent exercise was bad. And off he pops like greased lightning. And off with him and out trying to walk straight. And old. And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him. And once at masstime he had gone to play. And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame’s school. And one day she with. And one more to hail him: ave, rabbi: the Tinahely twelve. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don’t be talking. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt. And one shilling threepence change. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd that kept the hotel. And on our virgin sward. And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously. And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. —And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face. And past Nichols’ the undertaker. And past the sailors’ home. And played so exquisitely, treat to hear. And plotting that murder all the time. —And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded. —And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation. And pray for us. And pray for us. And Prosper Loré’s huguenot name. And put down the five shillings too. And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. And quickly too! And quite easy to milk. And really did great good in his way. And really it’s better the position... because often I used to wet... —And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son’s life. And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank, Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two more tankards if she did not mind. And Ristori in Vienna. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. And says Bloom:
—What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye. And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence:
—Who said Christ is good? And says he:
—Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And says J. J.:
—Considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision. And says Joe:
—Could you make a hole in another pint? And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:
—It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise. And says John Wyse:
—Full many a flower is born to blush unseen. And says John Wyse:
—’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance. And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:
—Conspuez les Anglais! And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders. And says she and says he. And says the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. And scourge himself! And second tankard told her so. —And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer. And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that. And she can do the other. And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book The Lamplighter by Miss Cummins, author of Mabel Vaughan and other tales. And she did bedad. And she said to Gerty:
—A penny for your thoughts. And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking. And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all accounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow’s was pewopener to the pope. And showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind closedrawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat’s udders in various poses of surrender, eh? And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner. And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup. And sir William Davenant of Oxford’s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary. And skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! And smiled yet again, in going. And snares of the poxfiend. And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end. And so forth and so on. And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. And so in point of fact they turned out to be. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all. —And so say all of us, says Jack. And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. And sovereign Lord of all things. And, spent, its speech ceases. And still his muttonchop whiskers grew. And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler’s Gazette. And sure, more be token, the lout I’m told was in Power’s after, the blender’s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. And take a piece of that bun. And take some double chin drill. And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned par excellence Lionel’s air in Martha, M’appari, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. —And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the... And temper getting cross. And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle. And that awful drunkard of a wife of his. And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it. And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day. And that old grey rat tearing to get in. —And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind. And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds. And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption? And the best admirals and generals we’ve got? And the best jumpers and racers? And the blame? And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl. And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen. And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she’s far from the land. And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. And the day I went to Drimmie’s without a necktie. —And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next. And the fruit on top. And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee. And the identical same with murderers. And The last rose of summer was a lovely song. And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And the little mirror in his silk hat. And the missus is master. And the mulled rum. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times. And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end:
     —As bad as old Antonio,
     For he left me on my ownio. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag. And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon. And then laughed more. And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, Bella was the boat’s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: Excuse me, my name is So and So or some such commonplace remark. And then she told him to say papa. And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat. And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. And then the heat. And then their stomachs clean. And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher. And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ. And then the usual dénouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all. And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. And the other little man? And the other one? And the other one Lizzie Twigg. And the others inclined to give her an odd dig. And the problem of possible redemption? And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly. And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! And therefore when he was urged, As I believe, to name her He left her his Secondbest Bed. And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn. And there he is too. And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver. And there now! And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. —And there’s more where that came from, says he. And the rest! And there’s the man now that’ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham. And the rest nowhere. —And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said. And
—There’s your teas, he said. And the retrospective arrangement. And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. —And the sense of property, Stephen said. And the sergeant grinning up. And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats. And the skulls we were acracking when M’Carthy took the floor. —And the story, sir? And the tephilim no what’s this they call it poor papa’s father had on his door to touch. —And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery. And the Trinity jibs in their mortarboards. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played
     He drove it o’er the jew’s garden wall. And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played
     He broke the jew’s windows all. And the viceroy was there with his lady. And the whole world was full of that sort of thing. —And the wife with typhoid fever! And the women, fear of God in their faces. And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple. And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running. And they are the signs of a nation’s decay. And they are throbbing: heroes’ hearts. And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe’s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel. And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And they call me the jewel of Asia! And they call me the jewel of Asia,
     Of Asia,
     The geisha. And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves. And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham. And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom’s. And this food? And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody. And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth. And through the sifted light pale gold in contrast glided. And time, well that’s the time the movement takes. And tipsycake. And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes. And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. —And to think of your having to beg from these swine. And to think that she was a pawnbroker! And Turks the mouth, why? And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. —And twopence, he said, for a pint. And two streets off another locking it into a pyx. And under Ballybough bridge? And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? —And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery’s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw. And were on for a go with the jolly girls. And were they good boys at school? And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine. —And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. And what did the doctor order today? —And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. —And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? And what star is that, Poldy? says she. —And what’s the number for? loafer number two queried. And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced. And what was his name? And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him. And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan’s plasterers. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again. And when he had heard his voice say it he added:
—You don’t want anything for breakfast? And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. And when he’s wanted not a farthing. And when I makes water I makes water. And when I sent her for Molly’s Paisley shawl to Prescott’s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew. And when the first note. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And when the painters were in Lombard street west. And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be. And while she gazed her heart went pitapat. And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. —And white wax also, he said. —And who does he suspect? says the citizen. And who is the gentleman does be visiting there? And who was he, tell us? And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. And why did you? And why no other children born? And why not? And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius. —And will again, says Joe. And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim’s... And with a great future behind him. And with a woman, for instance. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame. And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him. —And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh. And words. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away? —And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea. And yet and yet! And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit. And you a married man with a single girl! And you can see the darkness in their eyes. And you, father? And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. And you might put down M’Coy’s name too. And you refused. —And your lord and master? And yourself? And you think you’re listening to the etherial. And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes because it was expected in the Lady’s Pictorial that electric blue would be worn with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection. An eightpenny in the Burton. An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king’s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation. An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face. AN ELECTOR: Three times three for our future chief magistrate! An emerald set in the ring of the sea. Anemic a little. An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved. —A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face:
—Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! An example? An example would be better. An exception here and there. An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion. Angels much prostitutes like and holy apostles big damn ruffians. Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don’t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha’s perfume. An hour ago I was passing there. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber, Tom Kernan can dress. A night watchman. An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. Animals go by that. An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly. —An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion. An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach. An indistinct daguerreotype of Rudolf Virag and his father Leopold Virag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their respectively 1st and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar, Hungary. An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch Bacc. An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died. An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh’s unshaven blackspectacled face. An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner. An instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage. An instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station at ten past eleven. An instant of blind rut. An Irishman must think like that, I daresay. An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts of Vienna. An ivory bookmark told him the page. Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father. Anniversary. Annoyed if you don’t. An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles. An object falls. A NOBLEWOMAN: Nobly. A noble work! A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world. An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk. A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck. An old friend of mine. An old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison. An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells. An old plumber named Geraghty. AN OLD RESIDENT: You’re a credit to your country, sir, that’s what you are. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow. An omelette on the... An opening was all was wanted. An optical illusion. An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. Another! Another girl’s plait cut. Another gone. Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact. Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:
—Racing special! Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. Another themselves? Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content. Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything. Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative. Another time. An outburst of cheering. An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. Answer. Answer. Answered anyhow. —Answering an ad? keen Richie’s eyes asked Bloom. Answer something. Antient concert rooms. —Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling. —Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress don’t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis and let her live in his villa. —Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. —Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Antitreating is about the size of it. Ant milks aphis. An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time. An unseeing stripling stood in the door. An utter cad he had been! Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone. Any advance on five shillings? Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Anybody here for there? Any brollies or gumboots in the fambly? Any chance of your wash. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Any general to any officers. Any God’s quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose. Any good in your mind? Anyhow he was all in. Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable. Anyhow I got the best of that. Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation-cum-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soirée, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:
     —The biscuits was as hard as brass
     And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse. Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved. —Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons. Anyhow she wants the money. Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new. Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. A nymph immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods. An you be the king’s messengers God shield His Majesty! you shall not want for aught. Anything but that. —Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe? Any time he likes, tell him. 
 A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirting Rabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. A pad. A pad to blot. A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies’ hose, a pair of new violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies’ drawers of India mull, cut on generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti’s Turkish cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded curvilinear, a camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened, having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore side in white lettering B. C. T. Brian Cooper Tweedy. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year. A pallid suetfaced young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin. A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman, silkhatted, Jack Power, Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard, Nosey Flynn, M’Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One. A papal bull! A paper. A paper with something written on it is handed into court. Apart. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses. A patient silhouette waited, listening. A pause by the wayside. A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER: That’s the famous Bloom now, the world’s greatest reformer. A pen and ink. A people sheltered within his voice. —A perfect cretic! the professor said. A Peter O’Brien! A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entrée into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B. A. a huge ad in its way and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out. A photo it isn’t. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings of excess. Aphro. Aphrodis. Aphrodisiac? A piano sounds. —A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A pigmy woman swings on a rope slung between two railings, counting. A pillar of the cloud by day. A pishogue, if you know what that is. —A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said. Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the trees near Goose green playing the monkeys. A plagiarist. A plasterer’s bucket. A plate crashes: a woman screams: a child wails. A play! A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips. A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A plumtree in a meatpot, registered trade mark. Apocalypse. A poet, yes, but an Englishman too. A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand. A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom’s window. A POLISHED PERIOD
 J. J. O’Molloy resumed, moulding his words:
—He said of it: that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live. Apollo that was. Apologise. A ponderous Saxon. A poor hardworking industrious man! A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! —A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added. A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped. Apoplectic. A porterbottle stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough. A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse. Apothecaries’ hall. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble. Appetite like an albatross. Apply for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life. Appointment we made knowing we’d never, well hardly ever. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends. Appropriate. A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness. A prepared scheme based on a study of the laws of probability to break the bank at Monte Carlo. A primrose doublet, fortune’s knave, smiled on my fear. A private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash system the result of a national equine handicap flat or steeplechase of 1 or more miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1 at 3 hr 8 m p.m. at Ascot Greenwich time, the message being received and available for betting purposes in Dublin at 2.59 p.m. A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement: to obtain a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 5 Dame Street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing Lane, London E. C.: to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in the case of Hellenic female divinities: to obtain admission gratuitous or paid to the performance of Leah by Mrs Bandmann Palmer at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day. A punch in his dinner. A pure mare’s nest. A pure misunderstanding. A pure stockgetter, due to lay within the hour. Aq. Aq. dis. ter in die. A quarter after. A quart of ale is a dish for a king. —A quart, Stephen said. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion. A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly. A rabbitry and fowlrun, a dovecote, a botanical conservatory, 2 hammocks lady’s and gentleman’s, a sundial shaded and sheltered by laburnum or lilac trees, an exotically harmonically accorded Japanese tinkle gatebell affixed to left lateral gatepost, a capacious waterbutt, a lawnmower with side delivery and grassbox, a lawnsprinkler with hydraulic hose. Arabesquing wearily they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twirling, simply swirling. A raindrop spat on his hat. A rank outsider. A rattle of pebbles. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times. Archimedes. —A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. A redress God grant. A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Aren’t men frightful idiots? Aren’t they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? —Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk. —Are there any letters for me? he asked. —Are those yours, Mary? A revolution must come on the due instalments plan. —Are we all here now? Are we going to be read? Are we going to win? —Are we late? Are you a Dublin girl? Are you a god or a doggone clod? Are you all in this vibration? —Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked. Are you asleep? —Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe. —Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried. —Are you codding? says I. Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Are you condemned to do this? Are you feeding your little brother’s family? Are you from the west, sir? —Are you going? —Are you going in here, Malachi? Are you going to win? —Are you going to write it? —Are you going yourself? Are you hurt? Are you my commander here or? —Are you not coming in? Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress? Are you not happy in your? Are you not happy in your? Are you not happy in your home? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob? Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you off? Are you of the unfortunate class? Are you ready? Are you saved? Are you struck dumb? —Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? Are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he. —Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen. Are you there?... Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder? Are you turned...? Argal, one hat is one hat. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyosauros. A ribald face, sullen as a dean’s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. A riddle! Aristotle’s experiment. Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. Aristotle was once Plato’s schoolboy. Arith. that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. Arm in arm. Armpits’ oniony sweat. Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile. A roar. A roar of welcome greets him. A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. A ROUGH: Laughs. A ROUGH: Our men retreated. Around the slabbed tables the tangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges. Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. —Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake and don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself. Arranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order, that of gardener, groundsman, cultivator, breeder, and at the zenith of his career, resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest and coat of arms and appropriate classical motto Semper paratus, duly recorded in the court directory Bloom, Leopold P., M. P., P. C., K. P., L. L. D. honoris causa, Bloomville, Dundrum and mentioned in court and fashionable intelligence Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left Kingstown for England. Arrest him, constable. —Arrivederla, maestro, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed. Arse over tip. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Art drooping under thy load, bemoiled with butcher’s bills at home and ingots not thine! in the countinghouse? Art has to reveal to us ideas, formless spiritual essences. Arthur Griffith is a squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. ARTIFONI: Ci rifletta. Artillery. Art thou real, my ideal? it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about twilight, wilt thou ever? and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it. Art thou there, truepenny? —A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on the breech. As? As? As? A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. —A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. As addenda, a tennis and fives court, a shrubbery, a glass summerhouse with tropical palms, equipped in the best botanical manner, a rockery with waterspray, a beehive arranged on humane principles, oval flowerbeds in rectangular grassplots set with eccentric ellipses of scarlet and chrome tulips, blue scillas, crocuses, polyanthus, sweet William, sweet pea, lily of the valley bulbs obtainable from sir James W. Mackey Limited wholesale and retail seed and bulb merchants and nurserymen, agents for chemical manures, 23 Sackville street, upper, an orchard, kitchen garden and vinery, protected against illegal trespassers by glasstopped mural enclosures, a lumbershed with padlock for various inventoried implements. A sail! A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite. A saint couldn’t resist it. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam’s. —As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord. As a philosopher he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part of any person’s desires has been realised. As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life at least 2/7, viz. As a physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence. As applied to Her Royal Highness. As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As broad as it’s long. A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade. A scene disengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there as some thought with their immediate pleasures. A scheme for the development of Irish tourist traffic in and around Dublin by means of petrolpropelled riverboats, plying in the fluvial fairway between Island bridge and Ringsend, charabancs, narrow gauge local railways, and pleasure steamers for coastwise navigation 10/- per person per day, guide trilingual included. A scheme for the repristination of passenger and goods traffics over Irish waterways, when freed from weedbeds. A scheme for the use of dogvans and goatvans for the delivery of early morning milk. A scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour commissioners for the exploitation of white coal hydraulic power, obtained by hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at Dublin bar or at head of water at Poulaphouca or Powerscourt or catchment basins of main streams for the economic production of 500,000 W. H. P. of electricity. A scheme to connect by tramline the Cattle Market North Circular road and Prussia street with the quays Sheriff street, lower, and East Wall, parallel with the Link line railway laid in conjunction with the Great Southern and Western railway line between the cattle park, Liffey junction, and terminus of Midland Great Western Railway 43 to 45 North Wall, in proximity to the terminal stations or Dublin branches of Great Central Railway, Midland Railway of England, City of Dublin Steam Packet Company, Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, Dublin and Glasgow Steam Packet Company, Glasgow, Dublin and Londonderry Steam Packet Company Laird line, British and Irish Steam Packet Company, Dublin and Morecambe Steamers, London and North Western Railway Company, Dublin Port and Docks Board Landing Sheds and transit sheds of Palgrave, Murphy and Company, steamship owners, agents for steamers from Mediterranean, Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium and Holland and for Liverpool Underwriters’ Association, the cost of acquired rolling stock for animal transport and of additional mileage operated by the Dublin United Tramways Company, limited, to be covered by graziers’ fees. A scheme to enclose the peninsular delta of the North Bull at Dollymount and erect on the space of the foreland, used for golf links and rifle ranges, an asphalted esplanade with casinos, booths, shooting galleries, hotels, boardinghouses, readingrooms, establishments for mixed bathing. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows. A score of years are blown away. —Ascot. Ascot meeting, the Gold Cup. A screaming bittern’s harsh high whistle shrieks. —As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. As easy stop the sea. A sentinel: isle of dreadful thirst. A servant too. A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door. A server of a servant. A sevenmonths’ child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade. Ça se voit aussi à Paris. As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired The Merry Wives of Windsor, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket. —As for his family, Stephen said, his mother’s name lives in the forest of Arden. As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l’Isle has said. As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark:
—I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder. As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces. As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup. As for undies they were Gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though Gerty would never see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her? As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oylsters! As God made them he matched them. As good as any other abbot’s charms, as mumbling Joachim’s. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. A shadow hangs over all the rest. A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. As he and others see me. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:
—Hold that fellow with the bad trousers. A shefiend’s whiteness under her rancid rags. As he mostly sees double To wear them why trouble? As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. As he set foot on O’Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from the parapet. Ashes to ashes. Ashes too. As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body. As he walked he took the folded Freeman from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:
—Poldy! A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! A shoelace. —A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders. —A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine. A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer. As I am. As I am. Aside. A side eye at my Hamlet hat. As if it wasn’t broken already. As if I was her clotheshorse. As if that. As if they did it of their own accord. As if you didn’t get it on the double yourselves. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley. A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months. A silver florin. A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O’Beirne’s wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. As in what ways? A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him. —As it should be, Mr Kernan said. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. As it was in the beginning, is now. A sixpenny at Rowe’s? Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. A skeleton judashand strangles the light. Ask her no answ. A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George’s quay. Asking. Asking what’s up now. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Ask me, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said. Ask my ballocks that I haven’t got. Ask them a question they ask you another. Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day’s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line. Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Ask yourself who is he now. A sleek brown head, a seal’s, far out on the water, round. A sleepy soft grunt answered:
—Mn. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king’s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As long as he lived: never. A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop. A small gin, sir. A smile goes a long way. As more than inevitable, irreparable. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant. A snack for supper. A snake coils her, fang in’s kiss. As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease. As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. As object lessons to explain: 1 the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2 the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, videlicet, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression. A sofa in a westend club. A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute: the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table. A soft answer turns away wrath. A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman’s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done. A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. A solution of the secular problem of the quadrature of the circle, government premium £ 1,000,000 sterling. A sombre Y. M. C. A. young man, watchful among the warm sweet fumes of Graham Lemon’s, placed a throwaway in a hand of Mr Bloom. A son of a whore. As on the first day he bargained with me here. A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth. A Spanish prisoner’s donation of a distant treasure of valuables or specie or bullion lodged with a solvent banking corporation 100 years previously at 5% compound interest of the collective worth of £ 5,000,000 stg five million pounds sterling. A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot. A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. As per prospectus of the Industrious Foreign Acclimatised Nationalised Friendly Stateaided Building Society incorporated 1874, a maximum of
£ 60 per annum, being 1/6 of an assured income, derived from giltedged securities, representing at 5 % simple interest on capital of £ 1200 estimate of price at 20 years’ purchase, of which 1/3 to be paid on acquisition and the balance in the form of annual rent, viz. As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window. A split is gone for the flatties. A sprawled form sneezes. A spy. A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian file. A squad of others, marching irregularly, rounded Trinity railings making for the station. Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees. As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings. —As regards these, he began. As said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods’ roes while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate. Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Asses’ skins. As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood. Assuefaction minorates atrocities as Tully saith of his darling Stoics and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of combustion. Assumed by any or known to none. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d’Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society’s Horse Show, Maggot O’Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon Lord Mayor of Dublin, Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew Pisser Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E. Blazes Boylan and so each and so on to no last term. Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction. As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction. A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth. —A star by night, Stephen said. A star I see. A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo. A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus born Goulding, 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom born Virag. A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn? As they are now so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed in College park. 
 As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines:
—Parnell’s brother. As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their tête à tête which, of course, he was utterly out of about sirens, enemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car. As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character. A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:
—Hockey! A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand. Astonishing the things people leave behind them in trains and cloakrooms. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smokingcap with magenta tassels. Astounding! A stout fox, drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, brighteyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her. A stratagem. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mile Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. —As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. A STREET CORTÈGE
 Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots. A stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by Daly’s window where a mermaid hair all streaming but he couldn’t see blew whiffs of a mermaid blind couldn’t, mermaid, coolest whiff of all. A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. Astronomy it was about. As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living. A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. A student. —As ’twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland’s portfolio, unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight... A suckingbottle for the baby. —A—sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often—previously— expectorated—demise, Lenehan added. A sudden screech of laughter came from the Evening Telegraph office. A sugarsticky girl shovelling scoopfuls of creams for a christian brother. A sunburst appears in the northwest. A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel. A sweetened boy’s breath. As we march, we march along, march along. —As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image. —A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. As you are now so once were we. As you were before you rested. At a corner two night watch in shouldercapes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A tag of her corsetlace hangs slightly below her jacket. A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine. At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its cooperative watch. A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. At another time we may resume. At Antonio Rabaiotti’s door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamp. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar. At Charenton I watched them. At Dolphin’s barn charades in Luke Doyle’s house. At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Ate. At each slow satiny heaving bosom’s wave her heaving embon red rose rose slowly sank red rose. A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block. A tear fell: one only. Ate by sharks after. A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word:
—Freeman! At eleven it is. A temporary departure of his cat. A ten shilling house. At first. At four. At four. At four she. At four she. At four, she said. At Geneva barrack that young man died. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain. A thing of beauty, don’t you know, Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. A thing out in the water. A third. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. At his armpit Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said:
—Hello, Bloom. Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. A thousand casualties. A thousand pounds reward. A throstle. A throstle. A thrush. A thrush. A 4th typewritten letter received by Henry Flower let H. F. be L. B. from Martha Clifford find M. C.. A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake. A tilted urn poured from its mouth a flood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper. A tiny coffin flashed by. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses. At it again? A Titbits back number. At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips. At least it’s not settled yet. At least that’s my idea for what it’s worth. At me. At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island. At night too. At night your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. A tolerant smile curled his lips. At once! At one, he said. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. At Passage was his body laid. At Plevna that was. At Ponsonby’s corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y.’S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. A traveller for blottingpaper. At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. Atrot, in heat, heatseated. A truce to threnes and trentals and jeremies and all such congenital defunctive music! A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha delta of Ursa Maior. At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow. At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K. C., Rufus Isaacs, K. C. On the stage, modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle † 1901, exponent of Shakespeare. —At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said. At the corner of Beaver street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether. At the corner of Wilde’s house he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke’s lawn. At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours. At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street. At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:
—Did you bring the key? At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey. At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them. At their joggerfry. At their lunch now. At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew. At the siege of Ross did my father fall. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his brothers fell. At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:
—Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss Mr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, alias the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. At this stage an incident happened. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle. Attract men, small thing like that. At walking pace. —At what o’clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face. At your service. A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. Auditively, Bloom’s: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe. August bank holiday, only two and six return. Aum! Aum! Aunty mine’s writing Pa Kinch. Au reservoir, mossoo. Australians they must be this time of year. Authentic fact. Autontimorumenos. Autumn. Avant deux! A veil awave upon the waves.

A vertical piano Cadby with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of Love’s Old Sweet Song words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum, forte, pedal, animato, sustained pedal, ritirando, close. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A very short space of time through very short times of space. A vestal’s lamp. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his deathclothes on to the cobblestones. A VOICE: Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David? A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY:
     Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
     Wiped his arse in the Daily News. A VOICE: Hold that fellow with the bad breeches. A voiceless song sang from within, singing:
—... the morn is breaking. A VOICE: One and eightpence too much. A VOICE: O rocks. A VOICE: Sharply. A VOICE: Swear! A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. A VOICE: Turncoat! A voice within the tower called loudly:
—Are you up there, Mulligan? Avoid. Avowal. Avowal. Avuncular’s got my timepiece. A waiter is he. Awaiting your further orders we remain, gentlemen,... A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his hands. A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions. A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom’s heart. A warm tingling glow without effusion. A wavering line along the path. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. A wee little wind piped eeee. Aweel, ye maun e’en gang yer gates. Awfully clever, isn’t it? A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. —Aw! he said. A whirring whistle: goal. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. A white yashmak, violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her large dark eyes and raven hair. A WHORE: He tore his coat. A wide yellow cummerbund girdles her. A wild piece of goods. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring. A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. —A woful lunatic! —A wolf in sheep’s clothing, says the citizen. A woman and a man. A woman brought sin into the world. A woman brought sin into the world. A woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. A woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain. A woman too brought Parnell low. A wonderful man really. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. Ay. Ay! —Ay. Ay. Ay. Ay. Ay! —Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript. Ay, and done says I. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Ay, ay. Ay, ay. —Ay, ay, Ben. —Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. —Ay, ay, says Joe. —Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number. —Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. —Ay, Blazes, says Alf. —Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Ay, but her milk is hot and sweet and fattening. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’s. —Ay, Corny Kelleher said. —Ay do, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. A yellow flower with flattened petals. A yeoman captain. Ayes have it. —Ay, he said, sighing. Ay, meacock. —Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket to scratch his groin. A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water. A young pullet. A young white heifer. A youth entered a lonely Ormond hall. —Ay, Paddy Leonard said. —Ay, says Alf. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. —Ay, says I. —Ay, says I. —Ay, says I. —Ay, says Joe. —Ay, says Joe. —Ay, says John Wyse. —Ay, says Ned. —Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one. —Ay, the Lord have mercy on him. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Ay, very like a whale. A zealous man, however. Azotes. —Ba! Ba. Ba. Ba. Ba. Babes and sucklings are held up. Babes in the wood. Baby. BABY BOARDMAN: Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth. Babylon. Bacc. attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Bacilikil Insect Powder. Back! Backache he. Backbone in front, so to say. Backers shout. Back fro Lapland? —Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out. Back of everything magnetism. Back out you get the knife. —Back to barracks! he said sternly. Back to the world again. Bad art. Bad as a bloater. Bad as a row with Molly. Bad breath he has, poor chap. —Bad cess to her big face! she cried. Baddybad Stephen lead astray goodygood Malachi. Bad for their tummies. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Bad French I got for my pains. Bad luck. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O’Gaunt. —Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Bad opinion of me he’ll have. Bad plan however if you don’t know how to end the conversation. Bad policy however to fault the husband. Bad times those were. Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. Bag under their tails. Bah! Bah! Bailey light. Balance! Bald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Baldhead over the blind. Bald he was and a millionaire, maestro di color che sanno. Bald, most zealous by the door he gave his large ear all to the attendant’s words: heard them: and was gone. Bald Pat. Bald Pat at a sign drew nigh. Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait. Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Bald Pat carried two diners’ drinks, Richie and Poldy. Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bald Pat who is bothered mitred the napkins. Bald spot behind. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. Ballsbridge. Bam! Bang fresh barang bang of lacquey’s bell, horse, nag, steer, piglings, Conmee on Christass, lame crutch and leg sailor in cockboat armfolded ropepulling hitching stamp hornpipe through and through. Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. Bannon in a cut bob which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M’s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne’s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne’s. Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom’s arms. BANTAM LYONS: Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger. Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly. Bantam Lyons’s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Bantam Lyons winked. Bantam, two days teetee. Baraabum. Baraabum. Baraabum! Baraabum! Baraabum! —Barang! —Barang! Barbed wire. Barber’s itch. Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie’s green. Bargains. Bargain: six bob. Barmaid in Jury’s. Barmaids too. Barney Kiernan’s I promised to meet them. —Barney mavourneen’s be it, says I. Barrel of Bass. Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. Bartell d’Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard... Bartell d’Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Bartle the Bread we calls him. Base barreltone. Basta! Bat again. Bath a most private thing. —Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. —Bathing Crissie, sir. Bath of course does that. Bathwater too. Bat probably. Baum! Bawd and butcher were the words. 279 B. C.
—Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. Be acted on. Be a feast for the gods. Beaming. Be a prism. Beard and bicycle. Bear’s buzz bothers bees. Bears in the zoo. Bear with a sore paw. Bear with me. BEAUFOY: Drawls. BEAUFOY: His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court. BEAUFOY: Shouts. BEAUFOY: You low cad! Beautiful! Beautiful on that tre her voice is: weeping tone. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Beauty and peace have not done it away. Beauty and the beast. Beauty is not there. Beauty: it curves: curves are beauty. Beauty of music you must hear twice. Be a warm day I fancy. Be back in a minute. Be candid for once. Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction. Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity. Because attraction between agents and reagents at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker’s one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Because he comes from Oxford. Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget. Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension. Because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to. Because he no pay me my moneys? Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. Because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard. Because I did. Because if they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better, at least so I think. Because I’m away from. Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices. Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe. Because it’s all arranged. Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was
     Cuckoo
     Cuckoo
     Cuckoo. Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed. Because life is a stream. Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired. Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him. Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand. —Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly. Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late. Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers. Because the acoustics, the resonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to the law of falling water. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure. Because their wombs. Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other ungual fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs Ellis’s juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter. Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what? Because they are imbued with the proper spirit. Because they want it themselves. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off. —Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. Because you get it out of all holes and corners. Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected the wrong way. —Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. Because you were so foreign from the others. Become invisible. Bed: ed. Beefeaters reply, winding clarions of welcome. Beef to the heel. Been to the seaside. Been walking in muck somewhere. Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop. Beer, beef, business, bibles, bulldogs battleships, buggery and bishops. Beer, beef, trample the bibles. Beerpull. Before. Before and after. Before born bliss babe had. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S. J. bend low. Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. Before my patience are exhausted. Before Rudy was born. Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. Before the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of pigeons flew. Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle. Beg. Beggar. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Beggar’s bush. Beggar somewhere. Begin! Begin all right: then hear chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Begins and ends morally. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Begin to be forgotten. Begin to get ready. Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted. Begob I saw there was trouble coming. Begob, ma’am, says Mrs Cahill, God send you don’t make them in the one pot. Begone dull care. —Begone! he said. Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish. —Beg pardon, the sailor said. Beg up! —Beg your pardon, says he. Behind. Behind a bull: in front of a horse. Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville. Behind him Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith’s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses. —Beholden to you, Joe, says I. Behold the handmaid of the moon. Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack
     See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,
     In the proud cirque of Jackjohn’s bivouac. Being afraid to marry on earth
     They masturbated for all they were worth. Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Beingless beings. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see the brewery. Be just before you are generous. Belfry up there. Belief in himself has been untimely killed. Believe. Believe he does some literary work for the Express with Gabriel Conroy. Believes his own lies. Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep. BELLA: Admiringly. BELLA: Almost speechless. BELLA: Angrily. Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan. BELLA: Clapping her belly sinks back on the sofa, with a shout of laughter. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress, enters. BELLA: Contemptuously. Belladonna. BELLA: Do you want me to call the police? Bella from within the hall urges on her whores. BELLA: Frowns. Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. BELLA: Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points. BELLA: I know you, canvasser! BELLA: Laughing. BELLA: Laughing. BELLA: Looks at the money, then at Stephen, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty. BELLA: Loudly. BELLA: My word! BELLA: None of that here. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bella Poetria! BELLA: Police! Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. BELLA: Screams. BELLA: Show. BELLA: Shrinks back and screams. BELLA: Turns to the piano. BELLA: What? BELLA: Who pays for the lamp? BELLA: You’ll know me the next time. BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY, KITTY: Ho ho! BELLA, ZOE, KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM: Chattering and squabbling. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor. BELLO: As a paying guest or a kept man? BELLO: Ask for that every ten minutes. BELLO: Changed, eh? BELLO: Coaxingly. BELLO: Cuttingly. BELLO: Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. BELLO: Down! BELLO: Dungdevourer! BELLO: Gaily. BELLO: Gives a rap with his gavel. Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward. BELLO: Guffaws. BELLO: His heavy cheekchops sagging. BELLO: Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him. BELLO: Imperiously. BELLO: Jeers. BELLO: Laughs loudly. BELLO: Laughs mockingly. BELLO: Peremptorily. BELLO: Points to his whores. BELLO: Ruthlessly. BELLO: Sarcastically. BELLO: Satirically. BELLO: Savagely. BELLO: Shouts. BELLO: Sneers. BELLO: Squats with a grunt on Bloom’s upturned face, puffing cigarsmoke, nursing a fat leg. BELLO: Stands up. BELLO: Sternly. BELLO: Twisting. BELLO: Well, I’m not. BELLO: What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? BELLO: Whistles loudly. BELLO: With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice. BELLO: With bobbed hair, purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer’s puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moorcock’s feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in. BELLO: With wicked glee. BELLO: Would if you could, lame duck. BELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh’s the cook’s, a sandy one. Bell scared him out, I suppose. Bells clang. Bells with bells with bells aquiring. Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife’s lover’s wife, the kerchiefed housewife is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand. Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting. Be mine. Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard. Bend down let something fall see if she. Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches. Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Ben Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed and all big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering castagnettes in the air. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly. Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth a deep note. Ben Dollard growled. Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright. BEN DOLLARD: Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone. BEN DOLLARD: Pansies? Ben Dollard said. Ben Dollard’s famous. Ben Dollard shouted, pouring. Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. BEN DOLLARD: Smites his thigh in abundant laughter. Ben Dollard’s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley’s woe. Ben Dollard’s voice. BEN DOLLARD: When twins arrive? Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air. Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs. Be near. Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband’s everyday trousers and turnedup boots, large eights. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot. Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus, Pater et Filius. Benedictine. Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years. Ben Howth. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. Beni, Bolivia. Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops. —Ben machree, said Mr Dedalus, clapping Ben’s fat back shoulderblade. Ben my Chree! Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay. Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering. Ben’s contrite beard confessed. in nomine Domini, in God’s name he knelt. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Be on the side of the angels. Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil may God restrain him, we humbly pray!: and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls. Be pfrwritt. Bequests also: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute discretion. —Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Beside him again. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toadbellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies. Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. Besides how could you remember everybody? Besides I can’t be so if Molly. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did. Besides they don’t know. Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she’s a flirt. Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their genus omne. Besides, who saw? Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him. Best enters in hairdresser’s attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. BEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it. —Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Best moment to attack one in pudding time. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes. Best of Best brothers. Best paper by long chalks for a small ad. Best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye on a mirror. BEST: Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.

Better buy one. Better cross here. Better detach. Better find out in the paper. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you. Better get that lotion made up. Better get this job over quick. Better give way only half way the way of a man with a maid. Better go. Better late than never. Better leave him the paper and get shut of him. Better let him forget. Better luck next time. Better not. Better not do the condescending. Better not stick here all night like a limpet. Better not teach him his own business. Better now of course than long ago. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned. Better phone him up first. Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis. —Better, said Tomgin Kernan. Better shift it out of that. Better sit still. Better speak to him first. Better turn down here. Better value that for the money. Better where she is down there: away. Better write it here. Betting. Betting 5 to 4 on Zinfandel, 20 to 1 Throwaway off. Bet to the ropes. Between Queen’s and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley’s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White’s, the pawnbroker’s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero. Between the curtains Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his fidus Achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke’s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Bet your boots on. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. Beware! Beware God’s hand! Beware of imitations. Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Beware of the steamroller. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life. Be worse for him, says he, nor any Rooshian. Beyond a doubt. Beyond Lundy Foot’s from the shaded door of Kavanagh’s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce

Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding’s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting. Bladderbags. Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Blank face. Blast you. Blast you! Blaze on. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar. Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth. Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. —Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders’ skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge. Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers’ pocket. Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before. Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.

Bloom askance over liverless saw. Bloom assented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt
† 266 A.D., suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. BLOOM: A sweat breaking out over him. BLOOM: A talisman. Bloom ate liv as said before. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. BLOOM: At the window. BLOOM: Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? BLOOM: Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar’s vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole’s eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. BLOOM: Because it didn’t suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.

Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent’s one, six to two, nine to three. Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. BLOOM: Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears. BLOOM: Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing, yaps. BLOOM: Her hands and features working. —Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.

BLOOM: Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, starred with spent snowballs, struggles to rise. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen’s hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands irresolute. Bloom, holding the hat and ashplant, stands erect. Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs. Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. BLOOM: How? BLOOM: Humbly kisses her long hair. BLOOM: Hurriedly. BLOOM: I? BLOOM: I am going to scream. BLOOM: I beg. BLOOM: I beg. BLOOM: I can give you... BLOOM: I have forgotten for the moment.

BLOOM: Lifts a turtle head towards her lap. Bloom listened. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. Bloom looked, unblessed to go. BLOOM: Looks behind. BLOOM: Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. BLOOM: Looks down with a sheepish grin. Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded. BLOOM: Low, secretly, ever more rapidly. BLOOM: Mamma! BLOOM: Meaningfully dropping his voice. BLOOM: Miriam. BLOOM: Mixed races and mixed marriage. BLOOM: Molly! BLOOM: Mumbles.

BLOOM: No, no, no. BLOOM: No thoroughfare. BLOOM: Not I! BLOOM: Not likely. BLOOM: Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. BLOOM: Obdurately. Bloom of Crawford’s journal sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy’s, Vin. BLOOM: Offhandedly. BLOOM: Off side. BLOOM: O, I know.

 Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. BLOOM: Over Stephen’s shoulder. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph’s hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Bloom passes. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepoke, sweets of sin, potato soap. BLOOM: Pawing the heather abjectly. BLOOM: Pay them, my friend. BLOOM: Peering over the crowd. Bloom picks it up and throws it in the grate. BLOOM: Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops and a red schoolcap with badge. BLOOM: Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears. BLOOM: Plaintively. Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech.

BLOOM: Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower. BLOOM: Propping him. Bloom puts out her timid head. BLOOM: Quickly. BLOOM: Quickly. BLOOM: Quietly.

BLOOM: Reflecting. BLOOM: Reflects precautiously. BLOOM: Regretfully. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves. BLOOM: Repentantly. BLOOM: Rosemary also did I understand you to say or willpower over parasitic tissues. BLOOM: Rubs his hands cheerfully. BLOOM: Runs to Lynch. BLOOM: Runs to Stephen. BLOOM: Rushes to the hall, rushes back. Bloom’s acts? —Bloom, says he. —Bloom, says he.

     The wren, the wren,
     The king of all birds,
     Saint Stephen’s his day
     Was caught in the furze. BLOOM: Scared. BLOOM: Scared, hats himself, steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft. BLOOM: Science. BLOOM: Screams. Bloom’s decision? BLOOM: Seizes her wrist with his free hand. Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Bloom’s features relax. BLOOM: Shakes Cissy Caffrey’s shoulders. BLOOM: Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. BLOOM: Shaking hands with a blind stripling. BLOOM: She counterassaulted. BLOOM: She is rather lean. BLOOM: Shifts from foot to foot. BLOOM: Shocked. BLOOM: Shoot him! BLOOM: Shoves them back, loudly. BLOOM: Shrinks. BLOOM: Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands: with hangdog mien. Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar. BLOOM: Simply satisfying a need I... BLOOM: Smiles, nods slowly. BLOOM: Smiles yellowly at the three whores. BLOOM: Snatches up Stephen’s ashplant. BLOOM: Solemnly. BLOOM: Solemnly. Bloom squeals, turning turtle. BLOOM: Squire of dames, in dinner jacket with wateredsilk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand. BLOOM: Stammers. Bloom stands aside. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe. BLOOM: Starts up, seizes her hand. Bloom stays with nurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up there. Bloom, stifflegged, aging, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces. BLOOM: Stifling. BLOOM: Stitch in my side. Bloom stood up. BLOOM: Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog. BLOOM: Stop! Bloom stops, at fault. Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth. Bloom’s weather. Bloom takes J. J. O’Molloy’s hand and raises it to his lips. BLOOM: Takes the chocolate. BLOOM: Ten and six. BLOOM: Terrified. BLOOM: Thank you, mistress. BLOOM: Thank you, sir. BLOOM: Thank you, sir. BLOOM: That is one pound six and eleven. BLOOM: The friend of man. BLOOM: The just man falls seven times. Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue. BLOOM: There is a memory attached to it. BLOOM: The stye I dislike. BLOOM: The voice is the voice of Esau. BLOOM: This is yours. Bloom three times, by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A., alone, in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James O’Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C.

BLOOM: Tries to laugh. BLOOM: Turns to the gallery. BLOOM: Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly. Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. BLOOM: Undecided. Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the slender catgut thong. Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet. BLOOM: Urgently. Bloom viewed a gallant pictured hero in Lionel Marks’s window. Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson’s Pillar, hangs from the top ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters shells included, heals several sufferers from king’s evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, Lord Beaconsfield, Lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Kossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. BLOOM: Warding off a blow. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about. BLOOM: Weakly. BLOOM: Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumb passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently. BLOOM: Well, I follow a literary occupation, author-journalist. Bloom went by Barry’s. BLOOM: What? BLOOM: What is that? BLOOM: What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? BLOOM: When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the Austrian despot in a dank prison where was yours? BLOOM: When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. BLOOM: Whimpers. BLOOM: Who? BLOOM: Who’ll...? BLOOM: Wildgoose chase this. BLOOM: Wincing. BLOOM: Winks at the bystanders. BLOOM: With...? BLOOM: With a sour tenderish smile. Bloom with asses’ ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. BLOOM: With desire, with reluctance. BLOOM: With feeling. Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. BLOOM: With precaution. BLOOM: With rollicking humour. BLOOM: With sinews semiflexed. BLOOM: Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly. Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast. BLOOM: Wrong. BLOOM: Yes. BLOOM: Yes. BLOOM: Yes. BLOOM: Yes, ma’am? BLOOM: You mean Photo Bits? BLOOM: You understood them? Bloo smi qui go. Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner’s name. Bloowho went by by Moulang’s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine’s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll’s dusky battered plate, for Raoul. Blotchy brown brick houses. Blot over the other so he can’t read. Blow gentle. Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table. Blown in from the bay. Blown in from the bay. Bluebags? Blue bloom is on the. Blue bloom is on the rye. Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night. Blue eyes beauty I’ll read your hand. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Blue jacket and yellow cap. Blueribboned hat... Bluerobed, white under, come to me. Blumenlied I bought for her. Blurt out what I was thinking. Blushing, his mask said:
—Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating. Bobbob lapping it for the inner alderman. Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this. Bob Cowley’s outstretched talons griped the black deepsounding chords. Bob Cowley’s twinkling fingers in the treble played again. Bob Cowley wove. Bob Doran falls silently into an area. Bob Doran, toppling from a high barstool, sways over the munching spaniel. BOB DORAN: Towser. Bob’s a queer chap when the porter’s up in him so says I just to make talk:
—How’s Willy Murray those times, Alf? Boccaccio’s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with child. Body fifty different colours. Body getting a bit softy. Body of white woman, a flute alive. Bohee brothers. Boiled shirt affair. Boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot. Bold bad girl from the town of Mullingar. Bold hand. Bold hand. Bold hand: Mrs Marion. Bolting to get it over. Bolt upright like surgeon M’Ardle. Bom! —Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Bonafides. Bone them young so they metamspychosis. Boniface! Bonjour. Bonjour! Bonsoir la compagnie. Boody asked. Boody asked. Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:
—Our father who art not in heaven. Boody cried angrily:
—Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat? Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:
—Give us it here. Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table. Boof! —Boohoo! Books you were going to write with letters for titles. Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Boomed crashing chords. Boosed at five o’clock. Booted the twain and staved. Boots giving evidence. Bopeep! Bored Bloom tambourined gently with I am just reflecting fingers on flat pad Pat brought. Bore this. Bore this funeral affair. Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness. Born courtesan. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Born with a knife. Born with a silver knife in his mouth. —Bosh! Bosom I saw, both full, throat warbling. Bosses the show. Both. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold’s face. Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire. Both ends meet. Bothered, he wanted Power and cider. Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both salute with fierce hostility. Both satisfied. Both then were silent? Both unconscious. Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial. Bottle of lager. —Bottles out there, say. Bottle with story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Bought it at the governor’s auction. Bought the Irish Field now. Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Bound for their troughs. Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick
     To greet the callous public. Bous Stephanoumenos. Bout ship. Bovril, by James. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot’s glorious heels so glistening in their proud erectness. Bowel trouble. Bowls them over. Bowsing nowt but claretwine. —Boyd? BOYLAN: A merry twinkle in his eye. BOYLAN: Clasps himself. Boylan, eyed, eyed. BOYLAN: Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks. BOYLAN: Jumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend. BOYLAN: Sated, smiles. BOYLAN’S VOICE: Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach. BOYLAN: To Bloom, over his shoulder. BOYLAN: Tosses him sixpence. Boys are they? Boys, do it now. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. Boys will be boys. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule. Brainfogfag. Brains on their sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin. Brain thinks. Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Brats’ clamour. Brave. Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. —Bravo! Bravo! Bravo, Simon! Breach of promise. Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Bread, butter, honey. Bread cast on the waters. —Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke’s the baker’s it is said. Breakdown. —Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Breakfast is ready. Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk. Break my spirit, all of you, if you can! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! Break your neck and we’ll break our sides. Breath? Breathe a prayer, drop a tear. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people. Breathe evenly! Breathe it deep into thee. Breathlessly. Bred in the bone. Breen. —Breen, says Alf. Brewery barge with export stout. Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled. Bridie! BRIDIE: Hatch street. Bridie Kelly! Brief exposure. Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these. Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it. Brigade! Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love’s leavetaking, life’s, love’s morn. Bright midges dance on walls. Brighton, Margate. Bright’s! Bright’s bright eye. Brilliant ide. Brimstone fires spring up. Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. Bring all your powers of fascination to bear on them. Bring a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed. Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his second bell the first bell in the transept he is lifting his and, rising, heard now I am lifting their two bells he is kneeling twang in diphthong. Bring in our chippendale chair. Brings back her girlhood. Brings on white fluxions. Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Bring Starkey. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Bring the camera whenever you like. Bring your own bread and butter. BRINI, PAPAL NUNCIO: In papal zouave’s uniform, steel cuirasses as breastplate, armplates, thighplates, legplates, large profane moustaches and brown paper mitre. Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow... British Beatitudes! Broad daylight. Broke his glasses? Broken heart. Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts. Broke them yesterday. Bronze and rose. Bronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened. [ 11 ]
 Bronze by gold heard the hoofirons, steelyringing. Bronze by gold, miss Douce’s head by miss Kennedy’s head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel. Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel. Bronze by gold they whisper. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar. Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan’s flower and eyes. Bronze gazed far sideways. Bronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Bronzelydia by Minagold. Bronze whiteness. Broo! Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most. Brother Buzz. BROTHER BUZZ: Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. BROTHER BUZZ: Then perform a miracle like Father Charles. Brothers and sisters had he none. Brothers-in-law: relations. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching to see if they can help. Brother Swan was the person to see. Broth of a boy. Brown brillantined hair over his collar. Brown, Robinson and Co. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. Brrfoo! B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. Brunswick street. Brutal, why not? Bubble and squeak. Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! —Buccinator muscle is... Buckled he is. Buck Mulligan answered. Buck Mulligan asked. Buck Mulligan asked. Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip. Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour:
—You put your hoof in it now. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried:
—A miracle! Buck Mulligan cried. Buck Mulligan cried. Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair. Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:
—He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama. Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:
—What? Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling. Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s wheedling voice:
—When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:
—Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone:
—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes. Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone. Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly. Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton’s desk sharply. Buck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Buck Mulligan said. Buck Mulligan said. Buck Mulligan said. Buck Mulligan said. Buck Mulligan said. Buck Mulligan said. Buck Mulligan said. Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet. Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight. Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on. BUCK MULLIGAN: Shakes his curling capbell. BUCK MULLIGAN: She’s beastly dead. Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder. Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets. Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith. Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:
—O, shade of Kinch the elder! Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter. Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice:
—I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the Summa contra Gentiles in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore. Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them. Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come. Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel. Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:
—Shakespeare? he said. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak. Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands. Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:
—So I do, Mrs Cahill, says she. Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly. Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum. Buenas noches, señorita. Bugger off, Harry. Built on bread and onions. Bulbul! Bulldog on the premises. Bulldosing the public! Bullockbefriending. Bullockbefriending bard. Bully about the muzzle he looks. Bumboosers, save your stamps. Burblblburblbl! Burgundy. Burial friendly society pays. Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium. Burke’s! Burke’s! Burke’s! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor, punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and what not. Bursting with money and indigestion. Burst open. Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall. Burying him. Burying his grandmother. Burying the dead. Bury the dead. Bushe defended him. —Bushe? the editor said. Buss her, wap in rogues’ rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! Busy looking. But... But act. But a day of reckoning, he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes. —But alas, ’twas idle dreaming... But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes? But a long threatening comes at last, they say. —But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife. —But Ann Hathaway? But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. But are you sure of that? But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word. But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice. But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other way and off with him. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge. But a type like that. But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed. But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason. But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion. But being brought back to life no. But being lost they fear. But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a marchand de capotes, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Arius Heresiarchus. But Bloom? But Bloom sang dumb. But Bob Doran shouts out of him. But both are joys. But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came. But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. But, by Saint Patrick...! But can those have been possible seeing that they never were? Butchers’ buckets wobbly lights. Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks. But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day. But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal? But Dignam’s put the boots on it. But do. But do. But do not know me. —But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early. But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face. But even if—what then? But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back. But flatter. But for example the chap that wallops the big drum. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. But Gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. But Gerty was adamant. But glad to communicate with the outside world. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things. But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life? But had to be. —But Hamlet is so personal, isn’t it? But hard to tell. But he adds: in bodies. But hear. But he believes his theory. But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed. But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together. But he had been kind. But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. But he has to say something. But he knows them all. But he might take my leg for a lamppost. But he must send me La Vie de Jésus by M. Léo Taxil. But Henry wrote: it will excite me. But he practically promised he’d give the renewal. But her breasts were developed. But here is the matter now. But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin. But he’s a Trinity student. But he, the young chief of the O’Bergan’s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. But he wants a par to call attention in the Telegraph too, the Saturday pink. But he wants just a little puff. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden. But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist. But his boywomen are the women of a boy. But his heart is buried in Rome. But, hising up her petticoats... But how? —But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked. But how to get there was the rub. But, hush! But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. But I bought it. But I couldn’t go in that light suit. But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under everchanging forms. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and alas to relate! the coveted castle too. But if not? But I know it’s whitey yellow. But I’m faithful to the man that’s treating me though I’m only a shilling whore. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king. But in leapyear once in four. But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty. But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb. But I say: Let my country die for me. But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don’t you? —But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me. But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn’t it? But it is so long since I. But it makes them giddy to look so they pull up their skirts... But it must end, she felt. —But it’s no use, says he. But it’s the evening influence. But it was lovely. But it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. But it was scarcely professional etiquette so. But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil. But it would be in the paper. But it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object. But I will fight for the right till the end. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better. But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky. But lady Maxwell had come. But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive? But let us bear it as was the ancient wont. But life is the great teacher. But listen. —But listen to this, he said. But look. But look: the bright stars fade. —But look this way, he said, rose of Castile. But lots of them can’t kick the beam, I think. But makes them polite. But Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror. But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour. But might happen sometime, I don’t think. —But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said. But my point was... —But my riddle! he said. But neither the midwife’s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock. But no matter. But not a pin cared Ciss. But of this apart. But one day you must feel it. But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, Bos Bovum, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show. But one should be charitable. But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow. But O, oblige me by taking away that knife. But, O Papli, how old you’ve grown! But our bucaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance... But ours is the omphalos. But perhaps he has wife and family waiting, waiting Patty come home. But perhaps I am anticipating? But possibly it is only a wart. But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question... But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long. —But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness. But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose. But stun myself too in the blow. But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up. But suppose now it did happen. But suppose you said it like: Martha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself? Butter and cream? Buttered toast. But that dress, the green! But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists. But that’s the most notorious bloody robber you’d meet in a day’s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days. But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood. But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all. But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead. But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove. But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful. But the first thing in the morning. But the funny part is..... But the Greek! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert if he had lived, Mamy, Budgy Victoria Frances, Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev... But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. But the morning she chased her with the umbrella. But then if he didn’t know only make it awkward for him. But then I have it in my left hand. But then Shakespeare has no rhymes: blank verse. But then the allusion is lost. But then why don’t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? But then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty? But then you’re in a cart. But the policy was heavily mortgaged. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show. But there are people like things high. But the recipe is in the other trousers. But there is another member of his family who is recorded. But there’s one thing he’ll never do. But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. But the shape is there. But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. —But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life. —But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures. But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. But they’re as close as damn it. But they were God’s souls, created by God. But this is the point. —But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently. But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne’s hall. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever. But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her. But wait! But wait. But wait awhile. But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. —But wait, Mr Bloom said. —But wait till I tell you, he said. —But wait till I tell you, he said. —But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated. But want a good memory. But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words? But we. But we have also Roman law. But we have it on high authority that a man’s worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. —But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay? But what did we ever get for it? But what does Shakespeare say? But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God. But when was young? But where is he? But who? But who was Gerty? But will he save the circulation? But with a little goodwill all round. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I’ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity? But you must never tell. But you want a perfume too. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt’s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. Buy a pair. Buy from us.

By deaf Pat in the doorway straining ear Bloom passed. By decease change of state: by departure change of place. By Dlugacz’ porkshop bright tubes of Agendath trotted a gallantbuttocked mare. By easy stages. —Bye bye all, says Martin. Bye for today. By gad, sir, a queen of them. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he was telling me... By God, he wasn’t far wide of the mark. By God, she had Bloom cornered. —By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there. —By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m living in the same place for the past five years.

 Did he rise uninjured by concussion? By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress. By Jesus, I’ll crucify him so I will. —By Jesus, says he, I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake!

By Larry O’Rourke’s, by Larry, bold Larry O’, Boylan swayed and Boylan turned.

 By lorries along sir John Rogerson’s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past Windmill lane, Leask’s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office. By mighty! By Mosenthal it is. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. By no manner of means. By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law. By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine. By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom. By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! By Stephen:

By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:
—Our lives are in peril tonight. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. —By the holy Paul! By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth 8 September 1870, viz. By them, the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath. By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females listener and issue, complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed. By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone. By the provost’s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl’s a Yorkshire girl. By the sad sea waves. By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a lady’s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous eau de Nil Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.

Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin. Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on. CISSY CAFFREY: Her voice soaring higher. CISSY CAFFREY:
     I gave it to Molly
     Because she was jolly,
     The leg of the duck,

Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried:
—Gerty! CISSY CAFFREY: With expectation. CISSY CAFFREY: Yes, to go with him. Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature. Cissy queried. Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order. Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set. Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes. Cissy’s your girl. Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him.

Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. —Consider that done, says Joe. Consistent with. Consort not even a king. —Conspuez les Français, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.

Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Continue. Contradiction. Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals. Convert Dr William J. Walsh D.D. to the true religion. Convivial evenings. Coo coocoo! Cooing. Cook and general, exc. cuisine, housemaid kept.

Co-ome, thou dear one! —Co-ome, thou lost one! Co-ome thou lost one,
     Co-ome thou dear one! Copulation without population! Cordelia. Cordoglio. Cork air softer also their brogue. Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street. Corncrake croaker: belly like a poisoned pup. Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust. Cornfide. Corns on his kismet however. Corny. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. CORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he’ll get over it. Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths. Corny Kelleher, asquint, drawls at the horse. 
 Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side. CORNY KELLEHER: From the car, standing. Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. CORNY KELLEHER: Good night, men. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in his eye. CORNY KELLEHER: I’ll see to that. CORNY KELLEHER: Laughs. CORNY KELLEHER: Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding. Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. CORNY KELLEHER: Leave it to me, sergeant. Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay. CORNY KELLEHER: Nudges the second watch. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom’s plight. Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghastly lewd smile. Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. Corny Kelleher said. CORNY KELLEHER: Scratches his nape. Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin. Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths. CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen’s and I told him to pull up and got off to see. CORNY KELLEHER: To the watch, with drawling eye. Corny Kelleher, weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders. CORNY KELLEHER: Winking. —Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said. Corpse. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall. Corpse of milk. Corpus: body.

Could have made oceans of money. Could hear a pin drop. Could hear them all at it. Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn’t that cane? Could I go to see Leah tonight, I wonder. Could make a kind of pun on that. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary. Could never like it again after Rudy. Couldn’t ask him at a funeral, though. Couldn’t eat a morsel here. Couldn’t hear what the band played. Couldn’t he fly a bit higher than that, eh? Couldn’t loosen her farting strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. Couldn’t sink if you tried: so thick with salt. —Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further. Couldn’t swallow it all however. Couldn’t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Couldn’t you do the Yeats touch? Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white. Could whistle in his own ear. Could you? Could you try your hand at it yourself? COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK: Carried unanimously.

Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing. Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily:
—A riddle, sir? Crown of thorns and cross. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly. Crucial moment. Crucifix not thick enough? Cruel. Cruel. Cruel it seems. Cruel one! Cruelty behind it all. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. Crumbs?

Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves, cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Davy Byrne said... Davy Byrne said. Davy Byrne said. Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:
—And is that a fact? Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:
—Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! DAVY BYRNE: Yawning. DAVY STEPHENS: Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick’s Day supplement. Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king’s courier. Davy Stephens, ringletted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys. Day!... Day!... Day. Day. Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall. —Day, gentlemen.

 And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when. Dedalus! —Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Dedalus’ daughter there still outside Dillon’s auctionrooms. —Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Dee. Deep as a drawwell.

Denis Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison’s hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Denis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely’s sandwichboards, shuffles past them in carpet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left.

Dick Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself. Dick Tivy bald? Dictates of common sense. Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father? Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience? Diddlediddle dumdum
     Diddlediddle... Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle. Did either openly allude to their racial difference? Did, faith. Did he? Did heart leap to heart? Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition? Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see? Did he fall? Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him? Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order? Did he remain? Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of the Plums? Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters? Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? —Did I kill him, says he, or what? Did I not take it up? Did I pull the chain? —Did I say that? he asked. Did it flow? —Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor. Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha? Did me good all the same. Did not: no, no: believe: Lidlyd. Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze. Didn’t cost him a red like Maginni the dancing master self advertisement. Didn’t he...? Didn’t hear. —Didn’t he, miss Kennedy? Didn’t I tell you? Didn’t let her see me in profile. Didn’t look back when she was going down the strand. Didn’t see me. Didn’t see me perhaps. Didn’t take a feather out of her my handling them. Didn’t you see him look at his watch? Did Roberts pay you yet? —Did she? —Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her. Did she know what I? Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? Did something happen? Did Stephen obey his sign? Did Stephen participate in his dejection? Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him? Did the guest comply with his host’s request? Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme? Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them? Did the man reappear elsewhere? Did the process of divestiture continue? Did they find their educational careers similar? —Did Tom Kernan turn up? Did too. Did ums blubble bigsplash crytears cos fren Padney was took off in black bag? —Did you?

Did you hear my brain go snap? —Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe? Did you leave anything on the fire? Did you meet him? Did you not know that? —Did you put in the books? —Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech? Did you read that report by a man what’s this his name is? Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting England? Did you, says I. Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately? Did you see his eye? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush? —Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water? Die, dog. Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed. Different feel perhaps. Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation. Different ways of bringing off a coup. Different with me. Dignam. Dignam. Dignam. Dignam. Dignam carted off. Dignam dead? Dignam is there now. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too. —Dignam, Mr Bloom said. Dignam of Menton’s office that was, Martin Cunningham said. Dignam, Patrick T, deceased. Dignam son, Bernard Corrigan brother-in-law, Jno. Dignam’s potted meat. Dignam’s soul... Dignam’s voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam’s dead and gone below. Dignam used to be in his office. Digs up near the Mater. Dillon’s lacquey rings his handbell. Dilly asked. Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat. Dilly said. Dilly’s high shoulders and shabby dress. Dilly shrugged her shoulders. DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS. ANNE WIMBLES, FLO WANGLES—YET CAN YOU BLAME THEM?

Dirty Dan the dodger’s son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Dirty married man! Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Disgrace him, I will! Disguises, clutched at, gone, not here. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning. Dislike dressing together. Dislike rough and tumble. Dislike that job.

Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant’s wife drove by in her noddy. Do him one in the eye. Do I contradict myself? Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers. —Doing any singing those times? Doing her hair, humming: voglio e non vorrei. Doing his level best to say it. Doing its level best to speak. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectable character. Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. Do it in the bath. Do it in the shake of a lamb’s tail. Do it standing, sir! Do like us. Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it. —Dollard, murmured tankard. Dollard, was it? Dollard, yes.

Don’t like all the smells in it waiting to rush out. —Don’t make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted. Don’t manhandle him! Don’t maul them pieces, young one. Don’t mention it. Don’t miss this chance. Don’t run amok! Don’t see him. Don’t stain my brandnew sitinems. Don’t strike him when he’s down! Don’t tear my... —Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen. —Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. Don’t tell me! Don’t tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched. Don’t want it they throw it at you. Don’t you forget! Don’t you forget that! —Don’t you know he’s dead? says Joe. Don’t you play the giddy ox with me! Don’t you see what I mean? —Don’t you think his face is like Our Saviour? Door closed. Door of the stables near Cecilia street. Do others see me so? Doped animals. Dope is my only hope... Do ptake some ptarmigan. Doran Lyons in Conway’s. Do right to hide them. Dos à dos! Dosing it with Edwards’ desiccated soup. Dost envy Darby Dullman there with his Joan? Dost love, Miriam? Dost love thy man? Do the grand. Do they know what they cart out here every day? Do they notice I’m in mourning? Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake? —Do, Tom Rochford said. Dotty. Doublebasses helpless, gashes in their sides. Doubled up inside her trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out. Double four... Double marriage of sisters celebrated. Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters. Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation. Douce Lydia. Douce now. —Doughy Daw! he cried. Dowden believes there is some mystery in Hamlet but will say no more. Do we yield? Down, baldynoddle, or we’ll wool your wool. Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh’s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. —Down in Westmeath. Down she sat. —Down, sir! Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms outheld. Down the edge of his Freeman baton ranged Bloom’s, your other eye, scanning for where did I see that. Down there. Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Down, up, forward, back. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky’s vest and all, with the rope round him. Down with Bloom! —Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa’s little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father. Downy hair there too. Do you? Do you believe your own theory? —Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type? Do you despise? —Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Do you follow me? Do you follow me? Do you intend to pay it back? Do you know anything about Pyrrhus? Do you know him? Do you know that? Do you know that he’s balmy? Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn. —Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue? Do you know what? Do you know what he did last night? Do you know what I’m going to tell you? Do you know what I’m telling you? Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s mouth? Do you know what it is? Do you know what you are talking about? Do you know what you look like? Do you like cocoa? Do you mean he... —Do you mean he died so? Do you not think it, Stephen? —Do you now? Do you remember? Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it? Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night, Georgina Simpson’s housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Do you remember her, Vincent? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Do you see that straw? Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured? —Do you tell me so? Do you think he has genius really? —Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking. Do you think she was? Do you think that’s a good idea? Do you think the writer of Antony and Cleopatra, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Do you think they are genuine? —Do you understand how to do them now? he asked. —Do you understand now? —Do you understand what he says? Do you want another? —Do you want the blind up? Do you want three girls? —Do you want to cross? Do you want to cross? Do you want to go to Molesworth street? —Do you wish me to tell you? he asked. Drago’s shopbell ringing. —Drain? Drained all the manhood out of me, little wretch. Drat the man! Drawers: little kick, taking them off. Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:
—It is a symbol of Irish art. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums. Drawn on a guncarriage. Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. Dr Bob Kenny is attending her. DR CROTTHERS: I have examined the patient’s urine. DR DIXON: Reads a bill of health. Dreadful. Dreadful life sailors have too. Dreadful old case. Dreadful simply! Dream he had, a nightmare. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you. Dreams all night. Dreamt last night? Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic. Dreck! Dress does it. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. Dressing in mother’s clothes. Dressing, undressing. Dress they look at. Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you’re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you. Dressy fellow he was once. Dr Horne got her in. Dr Hy Franks. Dr Hy Franks. Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do. Dringadring! Dringdring! Dringdring! Drink. Drinkers, drinking, laughed spluttering, their drink against their breath. —Drinking his own stuff? says Joe. Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. Drink, man, an udderful! Drink me piping hot. Drink that, citizen. —Drink! the editor cried. Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Drink till they puke again like christians. Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet. Drive ahead. Driver in John Long’s. Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. Dr John Alexander Dowie restorer of the church in Zion is coming. Dr Lucas. DR MADDEN: Hypsospadia is also marked. DR MULLIGAN: In motor jerkin, green motorgoggles on his brow. Droop shoulders. Drop him like a hot potato. Drop in on Keyes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. Drop into the D.B.C. probably for his coffee, play chess there. Drop in whenever you like. Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin. Drops. —Drown Barabbas! Drowning his grief. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. DR PUNCH COSTELLO: The fetor judaicus is most perceptible. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Drum? Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile. Drunk about the place and capering with Martin’s umbrella. Drunkards bawl. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Drunken ranters what I said about his God made him wince. Drunks cover distance double quick. Dry. Dth! Dth! Dth, dth, dth! Dublin. Dublin Bakery Company’s tearoom. Dublin’s burning! Dublin’s prime favourite. Duck for six wickets. Du de la is French. Duel by combat, no. Duke street. Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer’s railway guide, civil service college, Gill’s, catholic club, the industrious blind. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something. Dull, gloomy: hate this hour. Dullthudding Guinness’s barrels. Dun for a nun. Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name Ineffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no secret to adepts. Dunne, says he. Dunphy’s corner. —Dunphy’s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right. Dunsink time. Dunsink time. During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance. During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Dusk and the light behind her. Dust. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dusty Rhodes. Dutch courage. Dwarf’s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Dwarfs ride them, rustyarmoured, leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. D’ye ken bare socks? —Dying, he said again, if not dead by now. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Each, and for other, plash and silent roar. Each dish harmless might mix inside. —Each graceful look... Each has his banjo slung. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindorée, Silversmile, Silberselber, Vifargent, Panargyros. Each is equally important. Each lays hand on Bloom’s shoulder. Each person too. Each street different smell. Earnestly. Earnestly. Earth, fire, water. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. Easier than the dreamy creamy stuff. Easier to enlist and drill. Easily flew. Easily twig a man used to uniform. East of the sun, west of the moon: Tir na n-og. Easy now. Eat. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. Eat drink and be merry. Eaten a bad egg. —Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor. Eaten by birds. Eat first. Eating off his cold plate. Eating orangepeels in the park. Eating your groatsworth of mou en civet, fleshpots of Egypt, elbowed by belching cabmen. Eat it and get all pigsticky. Eat or be eaten. Eat pig like pig. Eat you out of house and home. Eccles street. Ecco! —Eccolo, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. Echo. Economics. Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta. Edward Guelph-Wettin! Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. EDWARD THE SEVENTH: Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket, and sings with soft contentment. EDWARD THE SEVENTH: Levitates over heaps of slain, in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face. Edward the Seventh lifts his bucket graciously in acknowledgment. EDWARD THE SEVENTH: Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly. Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out Panem de coelo praestitisti eis and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over. Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. EDY BOARDMAN: Bickering. Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils. Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby. Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him. —E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered. Eeltraps, lobsterpots, fishingrods, hatchet, steelyard, grindstone, clodcrusher, swatheturner, carriagesack, telescope ladder, 10 tooth rake, washing clogs, haytedder, tumbling rake, billhook, paintpot, brush, hoe and so on. E’en so. Effect on the sexual. Egging raw youths on to get in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the castle. Eggs on the bottles. Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily:
—Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,
 Never missed nor he never will. Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Egomen. E grazie. Egypt. Eh? —Eh? Eh? Eh... —Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh! Eh! Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you. Eh, what? Eight children he has anyway. Eight for a penny! Eighth and ninth book of Moses. —Eight plums a penny! Eightyseven that was. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands. Either you believe or you don’t, isn’t it? Elbow, arm. Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. Electric. Electric dishscrubbers. Electuary or emulsion. Eleven. Eleven, is it? —Eleven, I think, he answered. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. El hombre ama la muchacha hermosa. Elijah! ELIJAH: In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted. Elijah is com. Elijah is coming. Elijah is coming! ELIJAH: No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks. Elijah thirtytwo feet per sec is com. Elixir of life. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin. Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, Lacus Mortis. ELLEN BLOOM: In pantomime dame’s stringed mobcap, widow Twankey’s crinoline and bustle, blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her plaited hair in a crispine net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand, and cries out in shrill alarm. Ellis’s Three Trips to Madagascar brown cloth, title obliterated. Elster Grimes Opera Company. El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth. Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea. Embedded ore. Embedded ore. Emblem of luck. Embrace me tight, dear. Embroider. —Emigrants, Mr Power said. Emigration Swindle. Emperor’s horses. Emperor’s horses at Mürzsteg, lower Austria. Empress! Empty vessels make most noise. En avant, mes enfants! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore deux minutes. Encore, enclap, said, cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George Lidwell, Pat, Mina Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent with tank and bronze Miss Douce and gold Miss Mina. Encore vingt sous. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. End it peacefully. Endless, would it be mine, form of my form? —End of Pyrrhus, sir? End of school. Enemas too I have administered. Enemy? Enfin ce sont vos oignons. England. England is in the hands of the jews. English. Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled, whirling, they bewail. Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream. Enjoyed her holidays? Enjoying nature now. Enormously I desiderate your domination. Enough. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them. Enough of the inflated windbag! Enough of this place. Enough stuff here to chloroform you. En route to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out. Enter a ghost and hobgoblins. Entered into rest the protestants put it. Enter, gentleman, to see in mirror every positions trapezes all that machine there besides also if desire act awfully bestial butcher’s boy pollutes in warm veal liver or omlet on the belly pièce de Shakespeare. Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head. Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand. Entertainment for man and beast. Entertainments. Enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces. Enthusiast. Entr’acte. —Entrez, mes enfants! Entweder transubstantiality oder consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality. Envel. —En ventre sa mère, says J. J.
—Do you call that a man? says the citizen. Envy? Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity. Epi oinopa ponton. Epi oinopa ponton. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia. E quando vede l’uomo l’attosca. Equanimity? Erin. ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA
—The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane. Escargots! Esperanto. Esprit de corps. Established 1763. Esthetes they are. Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. —Et cum spiritu tuo. Et erant valde bona. —Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. Etiquette is etiquette. Et laqueo se suspendit. —Et ne nos inducas in tentationem. Et omnes ad quos pervenit aqua ista. Et vidit Deus. Euge! Eugene Stratton. Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Eunuch. —Eureka! Eureka! European conflagration. Evans, conduct this gentleman... Eve. Even admire themselves. Even comb and tissuepaper you can knock a tune out of. Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her. Evening. Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds. Evening Telegraph here... Evening will find itself. Even money Fair Rebel. —Even money, Lenehan said returning. Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit:
     Von der Sirenen Listigkeit
     Tun die Poeten dichten. Even Parnell. Even Phyllis could not contain herself. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. Even that brute today. Even the allwisest Stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. Even the great Napoleon when measurements were taken next the skin after his death... Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place. Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Every bullet has its billet. Every cove to his gentry mort. Every day we must do homage to her. Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Every knot says a lot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion’s history placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Every life is many days, day after day. Every man his price. Everyman or Noman. Every morsel. Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows’ breasts. Every nerve in my body aches like mad! Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds. Everyone dying to know what she’s writing. Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow. Everyone wants to. Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac foetus in foetu and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that as he said one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid as exemplified in the actual case with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers Sturzgeburt, the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. Every phenomenon has a natural cause. Everything on it? Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. Everything speaks in its own way. Everything was going swimmingly
... —Everything went off A1, he said. Every word is so deep, Leopold. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Ex! Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible. Example? Excellent. Excellent for shade, fuel and construction. Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters. Except Guinness’s barges. —Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out. Except scales up and down, girls learning. Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then. Excitement. Excites them also when they’re. Excuse... Excuse bad writing. Excuse me. Excuse me. —Excuse me, councillor, he said. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, the dictates of common sense. —Excuse me, J. J. O’Molloy said, entering. —Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them. Excuse, miss, there’s a whh! just a whh! fluff. Exercise your mnemotechnic. Exeunt severally. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. EXIT BLOOM
—I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes’s. Exit Judas. —Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan. Expect the chief consumes the parts of honour. Expect this is the. Expect we’ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health. Experienced hand. Explain better. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours. Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity. Explain you then. Exploitable ground. Explos. Exposure by mechanical artifice automatic bed or individual testimony concealed ocular witnesses, not yet. Expresses nothing. —Ex quibus, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, Christus or Bloom his name is or after all any other, secundum carnem. Exquisite contrast: bronzelid, minagold. —Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said. Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here has End by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Extremes meet. Exuberant female. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. Eye out for other fellow always. Eyes all over them. Eyes closed he totters. Eyes front. Eyes like that. Eyes of a toad too. Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent. Eyes shut. Eyes, walk, voice. Fabled by mothers of memory. Fabled by the daughters of memory. F.A.B.P. Got that? Fabulous artificer. Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl. Face like dip. Face of the all is lost. Face reminds me of his poor mother. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break, blossoming into bloom. Faces of Paris men go by, their wellpleased pleasers, curled conquistadores. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Fading gold sky. Fag today. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change. Fair play, here. Fair play, madam. Fair Tyrants by James Lovebirch. Faithful departed. Faith, he was. Faith, no, he says, Frank that was his name, ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague. Fall from cliff. Fall into flesh, don’t they? Fall of man. Fallopian tube. Fall quite flat. Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope. Fall, surrender, lost. False lull. Falstaff was not a family man. Familiarly. Families of them. Famine, plague and slaughters. Famished ghosts. Fancy being his wife. Fancy dress balls arranged. Fancy of a friend of mine. Fang, I feel. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat radiant, transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. Far. Far. Far. Far. Far. —Farabutto! Far away a donkey brayed. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea. Far away now past. Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done then be it so. Fare. Fare thee well. Farewell. Farewell. Farewell. Far in the grey a bell chimed. Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping. Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin’s King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey. Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball’s. Fascination. Fashion part of their charm. Fast and furious it was. Fate. Fate. Fate. Fate. Fate that is. Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat, neck. Father Bernard Vaughan’s sermon first. Father Bob Cowley played. Father Coffey. FATHER COFFEY: Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak. Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head. Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary. Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum. Father Conmee passed H. J. O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey. Father Conmee read in secret Pater and Ave and crossed his breast. Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse. Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east. Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square. Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways. Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night. Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice. Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left. Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble. Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book Old Times in the Barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere. Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he would certainly call. Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged. Father Cowley asked. Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand. Father Dineen wants... FATHER DOLAN: Any boy want flogging? FATHER FARLEY: He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an anythingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man. Father is a wellknown highly respected citizen. Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge. Father Malachi O’Flynn in a lace petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mass. FATHER MALACHI O’FLYNN: Introibo ad altare diaboli. FATHER MALACHI O’FLYNN: Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host. Father O’Flynn would make hares of them all. Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M’Carthy. Father, Word and Holy Breath. —Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled. Faugh a ballagh! Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance and lucrative work. Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing a winebottle. Faut pas le dire à mon père. Faut que jeunesse se passe. Fawcett. Fbhracht! Fear injects juices make it tender enough for them. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Featherbed mountain. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Fecking matches from counters to save. Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Feefawfum. Feel. Feel! Feel. Feel a gap. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed. Feel better. Feel better then. Feel fresh then all the day. Feeling of white. Feel it myself too. Feel live warm beings near you. Feel my entire weight. Feel my feet quite clean. Feel my royal weight. Feel no more. Feels locked out of it. 32 feet per second. Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk’s egg, prize of their fray. Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn composer, Baruch Spinoza philosopher, Mendoza pugilist, Ferdinand Lassalle reformer, duellist. Fell and cut it twentytwo years ago. Fell asleep then. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by. Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all before him, old chap picking his tootles. Fellows run up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into somewhere else. Fellows shell out the dibs. Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that. Felt for the curves inside her déshabillé. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. Felt so off colour. Femininum! Fergus now
     And pierce... wood’s woven shade?... Ferguson, I think I caught. Fergus’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Fermé. Fertiliser and Incubator. Fever near her mouth. Few lines will do. Few years’ time half of them magistrates and civil servants. Fff! Fff. Fff! Ffoo! Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt from their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: Euge! Fibres of fine fine straw. Fiddlefaddle about notes. Fido! Field seventeen. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities. Fierce Italian with carriagewhip. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen children he had. Fifteen millions of barrels of porter. Fifteen multiplied by. Fifteen she told me. Fifty yards measured. Figne toi trop. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing. —Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them. Filled with his god, he thrones, Buddh under plantain. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Fill it up with wind. Fill me. Fill us out some more tea, Kinch. Filthy shells. Filthy trip. Find damn all of himself that morning. —Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint. Find out what they imagine they know. Find the way in. —Fine. —Fine! Fine! Fine! Fine dashing young nobleman. Fine eyes she had, clear. —Fine lump of a woman all the same, the soi-disant townclerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. Fine morning. Fine poem that is: Ingram. Fine voice that fellow had. Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it. Fingers. Fingers was made before forks. Finish. —Finished? Fire away number one on the gun. Firebrands of Europe and they always were. Fire lit. First catch your hare. First communicants. First gentleman told Mina that was so. First he got a bit of a start but it turned out to be only something about somebody named H. du Boyes, agent for typewriters or something like that. First he tickled her
     Then he patted her
     Then he passed the female catheter
     For he was a medical
     Jolly old medi... First I heard of it. First I’ll have a go at you myself. First I must. First I saw. First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. First kiss does the trick. First Lid, De, Cow, Ker, Doll, a fifth: Lidwell, Si Dedalus, Bob Cowley, Kernan and big Ben Dollard. Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to consult the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military engagement, Plevna. Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria born 1820, acceded 1837 and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York real and of His Majesty King Brian Boru imaginary: thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist’s non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist’s revelations of white articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she Nelly Bouverist was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from Everybody’s Book of Jokes 1000 pages and a laugh in every one: sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton. —First my riddle, Lenehan said. First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon’s in Terenure. First of the month it must have been or the second. —First, our little financial settlement, he said. First place murderer makes for. First rate, sir. —First round Dunphy’s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage. First sweet then savoury. First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff. First thing strikes anybody. First thoughts are best. First to the meet and in at the death. First turn to the left. FIRST WATCH: Caught in the act. FIRST WATCH: Come. FIRST WATCH: Draws his truncheon. FIRST WATCH: He is a marked man. FIRST WATCH: Infernal machine with a time fuse. FIRST WATCH: It is not in the penny catechism. FIRST WATCH: It was only in case of corporal injuries I’d have to report it at the station. FIRST WATCH: Laughs. FIRST WATCH: Name and address.

Fishgluey slime her heaving embonpoint!. Fish’s face, bloodless and livid. Fit as a fiddle only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his person. Fit for a prince’s. Fits me down to the ground. Fitted her like a glove, shoulders and hips. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour. Fitzharris. —Five. Five bob I gave. Five Dig. Five fathoms out there. Five guineas about. Five guineas a jugular. Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum. Five months. Five number ones. Five, seven, nine. Five shillings. Five, six: the nacheinander. Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny’s corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone’s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L. Y.’S and plodded back as they had come. Five to three. Five young children. Fizz and Red bank oysters. Flag of distress. Flakes of pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek. Flapdoodle to feed fools on. Flap ears to match. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips. Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back. Flatter. Flatters them. Flattery where least expected. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water. Flaxseed tea. Flayed glasseyed sheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling nosejam on sawdust. Flea having a good square meal. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Fleshpots of Egypt. Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick. Flies come before he’s well dead. Flies’ picnic too. Flimsy China silks. Flipperty Jippert. Flood, gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. FLORRY: And me? FLORRY: And the song? FLORRY: Are you out of Maynooth? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it’s up to you to sense that cosmic force. FLORRY: Dreams goes by contraries. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. FLORRY: Give him some cold water. FLORRY: Hiding her with her gown. FLORRY: I will. FLORRY: Nods. FLORRY: Nods. FLORRY: Offended. FLORRY: Pointing. FLORRY: Points to Stephen. FLORRY: Pulls at Bello. FLORRY: Sing us something. FLORRY: Sinking into torpor, crossing herself secretly. FLORRY: Smirking. FLORRY: Strives heavily to rise. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofacorner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. FLORRY-TERESA: It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy’s three star. FLORRY: They say the last day is coming this summer. FLORRY: To Stephen. FLORRY: What? Florry whispers to her. FLORRY: With a glass of water, enters. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes. Flowers, incense, candles melting. Flowers of idleness. Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Flowerville. Flow over them with your waves and with your waters,
     Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir... Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled. Flutier. Flybynight. Foghorns hoot. Fol. Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Follow. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed. Follow me up to Carlow. Folly. Folly am I writing? Fontenoy, eh? Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their truncheons. Fool and his money. Fool someone else, not me. Foot and mouth? —Foot and mouth. Foot and Mouth. Foot and mouth disease. —Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Footdrill stopped. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. Footstool! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! For a cat. —For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously. For aged and virtuous females. —For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. For all things dying, for all things born. For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles’ Lane. For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop: There’s a belly that never bore a bastard. For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped. For a plump of pressmen. For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy. For being so nice, eh? For Bloom. Force, hatred, history, all that. Force of habit. For creamy dreamy. For England, home and beauty. For entire colts and fillies. For every newbegotten thou shalt gather thy homer of ripe wheat. For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts you couldn’t squeeze a line of poetry out of him. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of. Forget. Forget: a dispossessed. Forget, forgive. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. Forgive! Forgive him his trespasses. For God’ sake, doctor. —For God’s sake! Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. Forgotten. Forgotten. Forgotten any little Spanish she knew. For Haines’s chapbook. For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks. For her birthday perhaps. For him! For him then not for. For Hindu widows only. For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. For identification, bucket in my hand. For if my master he did hear
     He’d make it a sorry ball.”
     She took him by the lilywhite hand
     And led him along the hall
     Until she led him to a room
     Where none could hear him call. For instance eunuchs. For instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark. For instance M’Auley’s down there: n. g. as position. For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely’s. For instance there was the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper a fact. For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White. For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word. For instance who? Fork and steel. For keeps? For Liverpool probably. For many happy returns. For me. For me! For men. For me this. Formless spiritual. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air. For my sake and for all our sakes. For my son Leopold. For my wife. —For near a month, man, before it came off. For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin’s parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part. For one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. For only her he waited. For Raoul! For Raoul!. For Raoul. For Raoul. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild. For shame! For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. For some man. For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. For terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house... For that are you pining, the bark of their applause? For that lot. For that matter so are we. For the Caliph. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the hoi polloi. For the honour of God! For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation. For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. —For the moment, no, Stephen answered. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother. For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop. For them unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. For the old hag with the yellow teeth. —For the old woman of Prince’s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. For the rest Eve’s sovereign remedy. For the rest let look who will. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat. For they were right witty scholars. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe. For this relief much thanks. For this relief much thanks. For those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery. For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show. For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. For trading without a licence, says he. —Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale. —Fortune, Joe, says I. For Ulster will fight
     And Ulster will be right. Forward to the ribbon counter. Forward, woozy wobblers! For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress? For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled? For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation? For what we have already received may the Lord make us. For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it. For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him. For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature’s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution’s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined? For whom? For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules...? —For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked. For you, please? For yourselves just. Foundation stone for Parnell. Found drowned. Found in the riverbed clutching rushes. Four? Four and nine. —Four bootlaces for a penny. Fourbottle men. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Four for sixpence. Four now. Four o’clock’s all’s well! Four omnipotent sovereigns. —Fourpence, sir. Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 8 87, 88 6. Four quid? —Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. Fourteen hands high. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Four winners yesterday and three today. Fox and geese. Fr. Fragments of shapes, hewn. Fraidrine. Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown. Frailty, thy name is marriage. Frailty, thy name is Sceptre. Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ Repulse, the duke of Westminster’s Shotover, the duke of Beaufort’s Ceylon, prix de Paris, 1866. France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer’s Phæacians. Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee’s time. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style.

From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slimsandalled, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear. From Ailesbury road, Clyde road, artisans’ dwellings, north Dublin union, lord mayor in his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard. From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus illustrated entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion. From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever. From Butler’s monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor’s walk. From Cahill’s corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M. A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. From Chickabiddy’s owny Mumpsypum. From clergyman, British naval officer, wellknown author, city man, hospital nurse, lady, mother of five, absentminded beggar. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled. From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two. From Gibraltar by long sea long ago. From Gillen’s hairdresser’s window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson’s image. From his arm a folded dustcoat, a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O’Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O’Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O’Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M’Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.

From hour to hour it rots and rots. From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o’clock postman, the glowworm’s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges. From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived. From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite. From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan’s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. From left upper entrance with two gliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator. From me. —From me, Kinch, he said. From one extreme to the other. From on high the voice of Adonai calls. From on high the voice of Adonai calls. From outrage matrimony to outrage adultery there arose nought but outrage copulation yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C. E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893 particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse Ulex Europeus. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, hayforks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter. From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice. From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed. FROM THE FATHERS
 It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted. From the forsaken shell miss Mina glided to her tankards waiting. From the Freeman. From the high barbacans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee. From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. From the liberties, out for the day. From the milkwoman or from him. From the playfield the boys raised a shout. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. —From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way. From the saloon a call came, long in dying. From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently. From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. 
 From the sundial towards James’s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James’s street, past Shackleton’s offices. From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester’s dress of puce and yellow and clown’s cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand. From the top spur he slides down. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye. From which if any of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune? From whom? Fro, to: to, fro: over the polished knob she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes her thumb and finger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring. Fruitarians. —F sharp major, Ben Dollard said. —F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F. T. Purcell, O.

Full she drad that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins. —Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. Full throb. Full tup. Full voice of perfume of what perfume does your lilactrees. Fumbally’s lane that night: the tanyard smells. Funeral be rather glum. Funeral of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute. Funeral was this morning. Funny I don’t remember that. Funny little beggar. Funny my watch stopped at half past four. Funny she looked soaped all over. Funny sight two of them together, their bellies out. Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening. Funny, very! Fun on the Bristol. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions. Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom which she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it he had appeared to have accepted cf hearthdreaming cat. Fuseblue peer from barrel rev. evensong Love on hackney jaunt Blazes blind coddoubled bicyclers Dilly with snowcake no fancy clothes. Futility. Gabble of geese. Gabriel Conroy’s brother is curate.

Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Gallons. Gallop of hoofs. Gambling. Gaming at Daly’s. Gammon and spinach.

Gaudy colour warns you off. Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. Gave her that song Winds that blow from the south. Gave it to someone. —Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history. Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling. Gawds teruth, Chawley. Gaze. Gaze. Gaze in your omphalos. Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. Gee! Geese stuffed silly for them. Gee up! Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches. Geld him. Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Gelindo risolve di non amare S. D.

GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS
 Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince’s stores and bumped them up on the brewery float. —Gentlemen, Stephen said. Gentlemen that pay the rent. Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. —Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently. Gently does it. GEORGE FOTTRELL: Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly. George Lidwell, eyelid well expressive, fullbusted satin. George Lidwell held its murmur, hearing: then laid it by, gently. George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand. George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe. George R Mesias, Bloom’s tailor, appears, a tailor’s goose under his arm, presenting a bill. George Roberts is doing the commercial part. Ger. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. Germans making their way everywhere. Gerty! Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down. Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses. Gerty is Tommy’s sweetheart. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain. Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands. Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. GERTY: To Bloom. Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out. Gerty winced sharply. Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins. GERTY: With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something. Get a grip of them by the stomach. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne’s. Get another of Paul de Kock’s. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what? Get a spurt on. Get back, stand back! Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brainwork. Get down and push, mister. Get down, baldpoll! Get him away, you. Get it out in bits. Get it out in bits. Get on. —Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition. Get out before the end. Get out of this. Get outside of a baron of beef. Get rid of him quickly. Get shut of it. Gets on your nerves. Get thee a breechpad. Get the pull over him that way. Get those policemen to move those loafers back. —Getting it up? he said. Getting on like a house on fire. Getting on to sundown. Getting up in a minute. Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing. Get up! Get up. Get ye gone. Ghaghahest. Ghostly light on the tortured face. Ghoul! Già. Già. Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen. Gibraltar. Gibraltar. Giddy. Giddy Elijah. Già: di lui. Gift of nature.

Ginger cordial. Girl friends at school, arms round each other’s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Girlgold she read and did not glance. Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter. Girl in Meath street that night. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Girl’s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman’s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction. Girl’s sweet light lips. Girl there civil. Girl touched it. Give a bleeding whore a chance. Give and have done with it. Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Give her beefsteaks, red, raw, bleeding! Give her too much meat she won’t mouse.

Give him twopence tip. —Give it a name, citizen, says Joe. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at him. —Give it up, father, Dilly said. Give me back that potato, will you? Give me in charge. Give me more than that. Give me my Wordsworth. Give me the fidgets to look. Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks. Given a guarantee equal to the sum sought, the support, by deed of gift and transfer vouchers during donor’s lifetime or by bequest after donor’s painless extinction, of eminent financiers Blum Pasha, Rothschild, Guggenheim, Hirsch, Montefiore, Morgan, Rockefeller possessing fortunes in 6 figures, amassed during a successful life, and joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done.

Give us that brisket off the hook. —Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat. Give us the paw! Give us the paw. Give us your blessing. —Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow. Give you the creeps after a bit. Give you the needle that would. Glad after she was that ere adread was. Glad I avoided. Glad I didn’t know it when she was on show. Glad I took that bath. Gladly glancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine. Glad to get away from other chap’s wife. Glad to hear that, old man. Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call him... Glass. Glass flashing. Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me. Glauber salts. Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk stockings.

Glimpses of the moon. Glittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought the face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. Gloomily. Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses. Glorious and immaculate virgin. Glorious, pious and immortal memory. Glorious tone he has still. Glory be to God. Glory be to God. Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Glowworm’s la-amp is gleaming, love. Glue em well. Gluttons, tall, long legs. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Gnawing their vitals. Go and lose more. Go and see life. —Go away! Go back. Gob, he’d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse’s apron on him. Gob, he’d have a soft hand under a hen. Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Gob, he’ll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I’m thinking. Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. Gob, he organised her. Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake. Gob, he’s like Lanty MacHale’s goat that’d go a piece of the road with every one. Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking. Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he’d remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. Gob, it’d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Gobstuff. Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop. Gob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s royal theatre:
—Where is he till I murder him? Gob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job. Gob, we won’t be let even do that much itself. God. God! —God Almighty couldn’t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain. God be with old times. Godblazeqrukbrukarchkrasht!

God fuck old Bennett. —God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said. —God! he cried. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate. God help his gamekeeper. God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten. —God! he said quietly. God, I’d give anything to hear him before a judge and jury. God ild you. God, I’ll tell him anyhow. God, I’m dying for it. —God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island. God knows what poxy bowsy left them off. God knows you have more spirit than any of them. God made food, the devil the cooks. God made the country man the tune.

Hackney cars, cabs, delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly. Had a good breakfast. Had any special agility been his in earlier youth? Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman? Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past? Had Bloom’s coin returned? Had enough of it. Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena? Had he found their solution? Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her? Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none. Had his office in Hume street. Had it? Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her. Had me decked. Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. Had the Queen’s hotel in Ennis. Had the time of their lives. Had the winner today till I tipped him a dead cert. Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family? Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener? Had to be. Had to look the other way. Had, too. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. Ha, give! Ha ha! —Ha ha, Alf, says Joe. Ha ha ha ha. Hah, hah, hah! Hai, boy! Haihoop! Hail fellow well met the next moment. Hail Mary and Holy Mary. Hail, Sisyphus. Haines! Haines asked. Haines asked:
—Do you pay rent for this tower? Haines asked Stephen. Haines asked, twisting round in his seat. Haines called to them from the doorway:
—Are you coming, you fellows? Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:
—That woman is coming up with the milk. Haines, come in. Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke. Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:
—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me. Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. Haines is apologising for waking us last night. —Haines is gone, he said. Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said:
—I don’t know, I’m sure. —Haines missed you, he said. Haines opened his newbought book. Haines, open that door, will you? Haines said. Haines said again. Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. Haines said to her:
—Have you your bill? Haines sat down on a stone, smoking. Haines sat down to pour out the tea. Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently. Haines stood at the doorway, looking out. Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone. Haines was the third brother. Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said:
—We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. Hair? Hair braided over: shell with seaweed. Hair on end. Hair streaming: lovelorn. Hair strong in rut. —Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own. Hajajaja. —Haja ja ja haja. Hak! Halcyon days. Halcyon days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom. —Half a crown, Stephen responded. Half a league onward! Half a mo. —Half and half I mean, says the citizen. Half baked they look: hypnotised like. —Half day, sir. Half dream. Halffed enthusiasts. Half of one ear, all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten. —Half one, says Ned. —Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Half ten and eleven. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price. Half the town was there. Half time, Ben. Half twelve. Hallstand too full. Halt. Halt! Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:
—Come up, Kinch! Ham and eggs, no. Ham and his descendants musterred and bred there. Hamilton Long’s, founded in the year of the flood. Hamlet, I am thy father’s gimlet! Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit
     Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth. Hamlet ou... Hamlet ou Le Distrait Pièce de Shakespeare
 He repeated to John Eglinton’s newgathered frown:
—Pièce de Shakespeare, don’t you know. Hamlet, revenge! Hamlet she played last night. Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Hammam. Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. Handel. Hand hurts me slightly. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. Hand in hand. Handker. Handkerchief too. Handle hrim. Hand on his heart. Hands felt for the opulent. Hands felt for the opulent. Hands moving. Handsome building. Handsome is and handsome does. Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I’m talking about is the female form. Hands stuck in his trousers’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing. Hands up to De Wet. Handy man wants job. Hangende Hunger,
     Fragende Frau,
     Macht uns alle kaputt. Hanging? Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that’s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him. Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Hangmen’s letters. Happier then. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy chairs under them. Hard. Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J. J. O’Molloy. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. Hard earned on the flat of my back. Hard lines. Hard time she must have with him. Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without. Hard to imagine his funeral. Hardy annuals he presents her with. Hark! Hark! Haroun al Raschid. Haroun Al Raschid. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of it. Harriers, father. Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint-André-des-Arts. Harshly, his pupils waxing. Has a good pair of boots on him today. Has all vanished since? Has anybody here seen? Has anybody here seen Kelly? —Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief. Has he forgotten? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? Has her roses probably. Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder’s court. Has little mousey any tickles tonight? Has nobody...? Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman? Hasn’t lost them anyhow. Hasn’t the soldier a right to go with his girl? Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent? Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long? —Has still, Ned Lambert said. Hast aught to give us? Has that silk hat ever since. Has the fidgets. Has the laugh at him now. Has the wrong sow by the lug. Has to change or they might think it a house. Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? Hate. Hate at first sight. Hate company when you. Hate people all round you. Hates sewing. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on those things. Hats off! Hat, tie, overcoat, nose. Hauding Sara by the wame. Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun. Haunting face. Have a finger in the pie. Have a glint, do. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house. Have an eggnog or a prairie oyster. Have another quart of goosegrease before it gets too cold. Have a notion I was here before. —Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred. Have birds no smell? —Have I heard all? Have it now or wait till you get it? Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Have no fear. Haven’t seen her for ages. Haven’t seen you for a month of Sundays. Haven’t you lifted enough off him? Have rows all the same. Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. Have their own secrets between them. Have to be spoonfed first. Have to let fly. Have to stand a drink or two. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? —Have you a cheese sandwich? Have you a little present for me there? Have you a swaggerroot? Have you a way with them? Have you brought a bottle? Have you cash for a short time? Have you drunk the four quid? Have you ever seen a ghost? Have you forgotten me? —Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with elder’s gall, to write Paradise Lost at your dictation? Have you good artists? Have you got an old testament? Have you got that? Have you got that? Have you no soul? Have your daughters inveigling them to your house. Have you read his F? O yes, but I prefer Q. Yes, but W is wonderful. Have you seen him lately? —Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Have you the? Have you the? Have you the? Have you the? Have you the design? —Have you the key? a voice asked. —Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned. Have you Weekly Freeman of 17 March? Having a wet. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt. Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap? Haw. Haw haw have you the horn? Haw haw horn. Hawhorn. H. Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor. He. He. He acts and is acted on. He added in a preacher’s tone:
—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns. Head like a prize pumpkin. He admires him all the more. Head nodding in time. Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded. Heads bandaged. Headshake. Heads I win tails you lose. Head up! Head up! He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void. He aint half balmy. He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini’s Stabat Mater, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. Health all! —Health, Joe, says I. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs. He always walks outside the lampposts. He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them hold that fellow with the: hold him now into the saloon. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. He and I behind. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried unsuccessfully to imitate—short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood. He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. He approached Larry O’Rourke’s. Hear. Hear! Hear! Heard? Heard as a boy. Heard from behind. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Hear, hear! —Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. Hear his voice in the house. Heart. Heart. —Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Heartbeats: her breath: breath that is life. Heart of gold really. Heart of mine! Heart on his sleeve. Heart to heart talks. Heart trouble, I believe. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. He asked. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus. He asked me to. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman. He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe. Heat brought it out. Heat convected, a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit. He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand. Heatwave. Heavenly weather really. He averts his face. Heave to. Heavier, I suppose. Heaviness: hot day coming. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Heavy greasy smell there always is in those works. Heavy of the past. He backed towards the door. He bared slightly his left forearm. He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom’s vulva. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: mea culpa. He began:
—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend. He began to check it silently. He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J. J. O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands. He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father’s, Gumley. He began to scribble on a slip of paper. He begins to lilt simply. He belches. He believed in animal heat. He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions? He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form. He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen’s waistcoat. He bends down and calls to Stephen. He bends sideways and squeezes his mount’s testicles roughly, shouting. He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic fracas when the fallen leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, leader’s trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the Insuppressible or no it was United Ireland a by no means by the by appropriate appellative and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O’Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals. He bent down to her, his hands on his knees. He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall. He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain. He bet them what they liked. He bites his thumb. He bit off a soft piece hungrily. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes. He blotted quick on pad of Pat. He blows into Bloom’s ear. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was worth. He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. He bore no hate. He brands his initial C on Bloom’s croup. He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air, questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper, things to tell her, excuse, desire, spellbound. He breathes softly. He brightens the earth. He broke away. He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt. He brought it near his eyes and peered. He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand. He brushes the woodshavings from Stephen’s clothes with light hand and fingers. He burst her tympanum. He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss the first! but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments. He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively. He calls again. He calls again. He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor. He came forward a pace and stood by the table. He came, he came, he did not stay. He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue. He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth. He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street. He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper pocket, said:
—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor. He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails. —He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups. He can never be a poet. He can’t make you out. He can’t sing for tall hats. —He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror. He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries. He caressed his beard, adding:
—Well, nearly all of us. He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling The girl I left behind me. He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle. He carries a large portfolio labelled Matcham’s Masterstrokes. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacob’s pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street. He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained. He ceased. He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence. He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger. He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did. He chases his tail. He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh. He cheers feebly. He chose badly? He chuckles. He clacks his tongue loudly. He clapped the hat on his head again. He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces. He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands. He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike. He closed his left eye. He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus. He closes his eyes an instant. He clutches her veil. He coasted them, walking warily. He comes from his dark corner. He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth’s kiss. He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously 23 May 1904 by a bee. He conjured up the scene before them. He consoles a widow. He corantos by. He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand. He coughs encouragingly. He coughs thoughtfully, drily. He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to. He could not leave his mother an orphan. He couldn’t get a connection. He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots. He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another’s foot had nested warm. He counts. He covered himself. He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned. He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:
—Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet? He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth. He cried above the clatter of the wheels:
—I won’t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. He cries. He cries. He cries, his vulture talons sharpened. He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates and Son, pricing the fieldglasses. He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive. He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel. He crossed under Tommy Moore’s roguish finger. He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. He crouches juggling. He crows derisively. He crows with a black capon’s laugh. He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear. He darts to cross the road. He’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it. He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:
     ’Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,
     ’Twas empire charmed thy heart. He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed. He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded:
—We come up this morning eleven o’clock. He describes Hamlet given in a French town, don’t you know, a provincial town. He’d give the ad, I think. He did come a wallop, by George. He did, faith, sir Tom. He did not look in the bucket. He did not see. —He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. He died in his sleep. He died of a Tuesday. He died on Monday, poor fellow. He died quite suddenly, poor fellow. He disappears. He disappears into Olhausen’s, the porkbutcher’s, under the downcoming rollshutter. He disengages himself. He’d look nice on the city charger. He does canvassing for the Freeman. He does look balmy. —He doesn’t buy cream on the ads he picks up. He doesn’t chat. He doesn’t hear it. He doesn’t know what he’s saying. He doesn’t know who is here nor care. He doesn’t see my mourning. —He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said. He does some canvassing for ads. He dons the black cap. He doth rest anon. He drags Kitty away. He drank. He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal. He drank and strayed away. He drank at her bidding. He drank drugs to obliterate. He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon. He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if, however—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality. He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes. He draws the match away. He drew and plucked. He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags. He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously. He drew his watch. He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket. He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried. He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench. He drink me my teas. He droned in vain. He drones bars of Ferrando’s aria di sortita. He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily. He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum. He eat me my sugars. He eats. He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer. Heehaw shesaw. Hee hee. Hee hee. Hee hee! Hee hee hee. Hee hee hee. Hee hee hee hee. Hee hee hee hee. Hee hee hee hee. Hee hee hee hee. Hee hee hee hee. Heel easily catch in track or bootlace in a cog. He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature. He emptied his pockets on to the table. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. He entered Davy Byrne’s. He entered softly. He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. He expires. He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh. He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:
—What was their civilisation? He extends his portfolio. He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car. He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot. He eyes her. He faced about and back again. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains. He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right hand at arm’s length towards the sun. He faced their silence. He falls back a pace. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. He feels his trouser pocket. He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He felt here and there. He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid’s, into the bowl. He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously. He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs. He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare. He flourishes his ashplant, shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point. He flung his wooden pen away. He flung the pages down. He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent:
     O, won’t we have a merry time,
     Drinking whisky, beer and wine! He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin. He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it. He followed his companions. He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars. He followed M’Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court. He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender. He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He forgot Hamlet. He found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible. He frowned sternly on the bright air. He frowns. He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the piazzetta giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach alles Vergängliche in her glad look. He frowns mysteriously. He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets. He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns. He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. He gasps, standing upright. He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. He gave him the coward’s blow. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their Maid’s Tragedy that was writ for a like twining of lovers: To bed, to bed was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: It is meet to be here. He gazed after the last broad tunic. He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. He gazed over Stephen’s shoulder at Goldsmith’s knobby poll. He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of his nose. He gazes ahead, reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design. He gazes far away mournfully. He gazes intently downwards on the water. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. He gets the plums, and I the plumstones. He gives his coat to a beggar. He gives the pilgrim warrior’s sign of the knights templars. He gives up the ghost. He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six. He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal’s mausoleum. He glanced round him. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy. He glares. He gnashed in fury. He gnashed in fury. He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles. He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. He got it this morning. He got that kink, fascinated by sister’s stays. He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod. He grows to human size and shape. He guffaws again. He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying:
—In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. He had. He had a father, forty fathers. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he’s gone to gather in the shekels. —He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory. —He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello barracks. He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked Poison. —He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said. He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste. He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots. He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him. He had his answer pat for everything. He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. —He had no father, says Martin. He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied. He had no wed. He hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw. He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse. He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low’s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa. He had spoken himself into boldness. He had two left feet. He halted. He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey. He halted and growled angrily:
—For England... He halted before Dlugacz’s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white. He halted near his daughter. He halted on sir John Gray’s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson through the meshes of his wry smile. He handed her a shilling. He handed one to the boy. He handed the card through the brass grill. He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen. He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom’s antlered head. He has a delicate mauve face. He has a house there too. He has a strain of it in his blood. —He has enough of them, she said. —He has, Father Cowley said. He has gnawed all. He has his bib destroyed. He has influence they say. He has legs like barrels and you’d think he was singing into a barrel. He has me heartscalded. He has money. —He has nothing to sit down on, sir. —He has nowhere to put it, you mug. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace’s private asylum for demented gentlemen. He has revealed it in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus. He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field. He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. He has that cabman’s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. He has the forehead of a thinker. He has the key. He has the romantic Saviour’s face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. He has travelled. He has washed the upper moiety. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests’ Protection Society which clears up everything. He heard. He heard, deaf Pat. He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past. He heard Joe Maas sing that one night. He heard more faintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for other, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar. He heard them as a boy in Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled. He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. He, he, he! He held her hand. He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:
—I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. He held his handkerchief ready for the coming... He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. He held out his copybook. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:
—Introibo ad altare Dei. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. He held unfurled his Freeman. He held up a forefinger of warning. He helped her to unload her tray. He hesitates. He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. He himself? He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler’s weak chest. He holds in his breath. He holds it towards fire. He holds my follies hostage. He holds out a forefinger. He holds out an ointment jar. He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor. He hopes to win in the gros lots. He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily. He hops. He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the, in the saddle. He howled, without looking up from the fire:
—Kinch! He hummed:
     Là ci darem la mano
     La la lala la la. He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:
     Don Giovanni, a cenar teco
     M’invitasti. He hums cheerfully. He hurried on eagerly towards the Freeman’s Journal. He hurries out through the hall. He hustled the boy out and banged the door to. Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Height of a tower? He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping. He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be. He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin 1 shilling, placed there presumably on the occasion 17 October 1903 of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade. He insulted me but I forgive him. He insulted my lady friend. Heirloom. He is about to have a baby. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore’s rocks or what you will, the sea’s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father. He is all in all. He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis. He is a mule, a dead gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not worth a cracked kreutzer. He is a new male: his growth is his father’s decline, his youth his father’s envy, his friend his father’s enemy. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense. He is a wellknown cuckold. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. He is going to visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays. He is going to write something in ten years. He is gone from mortal haunts: O’Dignam, sun of our morning. He is howled down. He is in my father. He is my double. He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William. He is older now you and I may whisper it and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch. He is our friend. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, woman’s slipperslappers. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer’s peas. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. He is right. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. He is running back to them. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. —He is, says Joe. He is seated on a milkwhite horse with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden headstall. He is sitting in their house, talking. —He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s frock. —He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O’Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission. He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. —He is, Stephen said. He is the ghost and the prince. He is young Leopold. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown. He jerks on. He jerks the rope. He jumped up and snatched the card. Hek! Hek! He keeps it free of weeds. He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers. He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation. He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran. He knew them. —He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He knots the lace. He knows. He knows already. He knows and will call in His own good time. He knows it well too. He knows them all, faith. He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals. —He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. He knows your old fellow. He knows your old fellow. He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: Tales of the Ghetto by Leopold von Sacher Masoch. He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees. He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:
—Will he come? He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully. He laps. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face. He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:
—O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! He laughed low: a sizar’s laugh of Trinity: unanswered. He laughed richly. He laughed to free his mind from his mind’s bondage. He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor. He laughs. He laughs. He laughs. He laughs. He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye. He laughs loudly. He laughs, shaking his head. He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes. He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and common searches and a writ of Duces Tecum. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin’s kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizardlettered, and a high pagoda hat. He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered. He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail. He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world. He leaps right, sackragman right. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk. He led the way, admonishing:
—We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? He left her and walked on. He left me on my ownio. He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before. He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam. He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare. He lifted his hands and said: All we can say is that life ran very high in those days. He lifted his voice above it boldly:
—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls. He lifts her, carries her and bumps her down on the sofa. He lifts his arms. He lifts his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously. He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes. He liked to read at stool. He lilts, wagging his head. Heliotrope? He listened to her licking lap. He listens. He lives in number 2 Dolphin’s Barn. Hell, blast ye! He’ll come to all right. Hell did I put? Hellenise it. He’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s Irish, says he. —He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. He’ll give a renewal for two months, he says. He’ll lose that cash. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. —Hello? Hello?... —Hello?... —Hello. Hello! Hello. Hello. —Hello, Alf. —Hello, Bloom. Hello, Bloom! —Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.

 At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines, Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper Rathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit. Hell’s delights! He’ll see you after at the D. B. C. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s Lovesongs of Connacht. Hell upon earth it is. He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He looked around. He looked at me. He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. He looked at them. He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He looked away from me. He looked behind through the others. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder. He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. He looked down intently into a stone crypt. He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke. He looked on them from his drawling eye. He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built. He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent. He looked towards the saloon door. He looked upon you to lust after you. He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck. He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. He looks cheerful enough over it. He looks down on Stephen’s face and form. He looks round, darts forward suddenly. He looks round him. He looks up. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish. —Help! he sighed. He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife. H. E. L. Y.’S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal. He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:
—The accumulation of the anno Domini. He made a mistake to fight the priests. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He made money. He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left. He makes a masonic sign. He makes the beagle’s call, giving tongue. He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise. He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. He met other schoolboys. He met schoolboys with satchels. He mews. He might be mad. He might be Mulligan. He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. —He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him. He mightn’t like it, though. He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee’s feet. He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly. He moved a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:
—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard. He moved a little to the side of M’Coy’s talking head. He moved away, looking about him. He moved his head uncertainly. He moved to go. He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom, of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing ’Twas rank and fame in his, Ned Lambert’s, house. He mumbles confidentially. He mumbles incoherently. He murmured that he knew the name. He murmured then with blond delight for all:
     Between the acres of the rye
     These pretty countryfolk would lie. He murmurs.... in the rough sands of the sea... a cabletow’s length from the shore... where the tide ebbs... and flows
... He murmurs privately and confidentially. He murmurs.... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... He murmurs vaguely the pass of Ephraim. He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. He mutters. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar. Hence this. Hence those snores. He never existed. He never forgets a friend. He never heard. He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely:
—Redheaded women buck like goats. He nods. He, not me. He now will leave me. Henpecked husband. Henry. Henry. Henry! HENRY: All is lost now. HENRY: Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted. Henry Flower. Henry Flower. Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cow’s lick to his hair. Henry Flower Esq, c/o P. O. Westland Row,
            City. Henry gallant turns with pendant dewlap to the piano. HENRY: In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.

        Dolphin’s Barn Lane
            Dublin. He of all men! He offended your memory. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays. He offers the other cheek. He opened it. He opened the letter within the newspaper. He opens his mouth, his head cocked. He opens it and shows it full of polonies, kippered herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills. He other side of her. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with no-one to point a finger at him. He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. He ought to physic himself a bit. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him. He pants cringing. He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent’s. He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue. He passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers. He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light. He passed Grogan’s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:
—Ask nothing more of me, sweet. He passed Saint Joseph’s National school. He passed the cabman’s shelter. He passed the Irish Times. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington, but in the convex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy. He pats divers pockets. He patted his waistcoatpocket. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error. He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points. He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat. He performs juggler’s tricks, draws red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his mouth. He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt. He pipes scoffingly. He pitched a broad coin down. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. He places a hand lightly on his breastbone, bows, and fondles his flower and buttons. He places a ruby ring on her finger. He places his arm on Private Carr’s sleeve. He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls. He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal. He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. He plucks his lutestrings. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails. He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself. He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe. He points. He points. He points about him with grotesque gestures which Lynch and the whores reply to. He points an elongated finger at Bloom. He points his finger. He points to himself and the others. He points to the south, then to the east. He poked Mr O’Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps’s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed. He preferred himself to see another’s face and listen to another’s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved. He pressed the same who pressed indulgently her hand, soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action. He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray. He prolonged his pleased smile. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named Omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural. He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father. He proves by algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather. He provokes my intelligence. He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air. He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid. He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper. He pushed past them to the files. He put down his name for a quid. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands. He put me off it. He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. He put the huge key in his inner pocket. He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on. He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom’s ear. He raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke. He raised his head firmly. He raises the ashplant. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible. Her artless blush unmanned me. He rattled on:
—Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. Her beam is broad. Her blue scarf loose, laughing. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, post mortem child. Her cerebral lobes are not functioning. Her clothing consisted of. Her crocus dress she wore lowcut, belongings on show. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in Coriolanus. Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here? Here. Here! Here. Here. Here. Here. Here! Here. He read, marcato:

         and
     ROSALIE the coalquay whore. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. He reads. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page. He read the other title: Sweets of Sin. He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S. Wisdom Hely’s. He read where his finger opened. Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine. Here are the darbies. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few weeks after. Her ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Here, bugger off Harry. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:
—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor... Here, citizen. He recorks himself. Hereditary taste. Here, don’t keep me waiting, damn you! He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations. He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist. Here goes. Here goes. Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women. —Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings. Here I am. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I? Here, I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs. Here, I can’t hold this little lot much longer. Here is all he... Here I watched the birds for augury. Here, Jock braw Hielentman’s your barleybree. Here, kiss that. Here lies poor dogsbody’s body. He remembered one night long ago. He remembered the initial paraphenomena? He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces. He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow. —Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Here, none of your tall talk. Here, Pat, return. He repeats. Here’s a good lump of thyme seasoning under the apron for you. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. —Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here see lost love. —Here’s fortune, Blazes said. Here’s good luck. —Here, she said. —Here, Simon, I’ll accompany you, he said. He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his defiance. —Here, Stephen said. Here’s the cops! Here’s this nobleman passed before. Here’s to us. He rests. He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son. He resumed:
—And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, Not a bloody bit like the man, says he. Here’s your stick. Here take your crutch and walk. Here, Terry, give us a pony. Here, thanks. Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. Here there try there here all try where. Here they are. Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time completely regardless of Ire the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark. Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch Staboo Stabella about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: The first three months she was not well, Staboo, when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. Her every effort would be to share his thoughts. Here was that of which she had so often dreamed. Here we are. Here wet the deck and wipe it round! Here, what are you all gaping at? Her eyes are deeply carboned. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling. Her eyes on me to strike me down. Her eyes over the sheet. —Here you are, citizen, says Joe. —Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Here, you were with him. Her falcon eyes glitter. Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O’Loughlin’s of Blackpitts. Her fansticks clicking. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon. Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling. Her first birthday away from home. Her first stays I remember. Her friend covering the display of. Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Her ghost at least has been laid for ever. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament. Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. —Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me. Her hair is scant and lank. Her hand ceased to rummage. Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher, a slow friendly mockery in her eyes. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. Her hand that rocks the cradle rules the. Her hat and head sank. Her hat sank at once. Her head dancing. Her he asked if O’Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O’Hare Doctor in heaven was. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in midbrow. Her high long snore. Her high notes and her low notes. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees. Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear. He rises slowly. Her large fan winnows wind towards her heated faceneck and embonpoint. Her maiden name was Jemina Brown
     And she lived with her mother in Irishtown. Her master, the Mona’s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. Hermit with a platter of pulse keep down the stings of the flesh. Her mother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken. —Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé. Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay. Her nature. —He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me. Herod’s slaughter of the innocents were the truer name. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed with orangetainted nostrils. He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead. Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair. Her petticoat. Her posies too! Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. Herring’s blush. Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts. Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep. Her sleeve falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Her songs. Her son was the substance. Her sowcunt barks. Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. Her stockings are loose over her ankles. Her the lady’s eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin’s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution. Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked. Her tomboy oaths. He rubs grimly his grappling hands, knobbed with knuckledusters. He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium. He rushes against the mauve shade, flapping noisily. He rushes towards Stephen, fist outstretched, and strikes him in the face. He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror. Her voice floating out. Her wavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevyhair un comb:’d. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops. Her wet lips tittered:
—He’s killed looking back. Her widow’s mite. Her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose. Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. —He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe. —He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam. He’s a caution to rattlesnakes. He’s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun. —He’s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He’s a gentleman, a poet. —He’s a hero, he said simply. He said. He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded. He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods. He said he’d try to come. He said he’ll be in the Ormond at four. He said nothing. He said softly in the bare hall:
—I’m going round the corner. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. He’s always bad then. He’s always doing a good turn for someone. He’s a minister in the country somewhere. He’s an excellent brother. He’s an excellent man to organise. He sang that song lovely, murmured Mina. He’s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet. He’s an Irishman. He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. —He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. He’s a proboer. He’s a professor. He’s a professor out of the college. He’s a safe man, I’d say. He’s as bad as old Antonio. He’s as bad as Parnell was. He’s as like it as damn it. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:
—The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. —He’s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O’. He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur’s yelping. He saved the situa. He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the Insuppressible or was it United Ireland, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said Thank you, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what’s bred in the bone. He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower. He’s a whitearsed bugger. He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future. He saw not bronze. He saw not gold. He saw their speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds. He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in russet, entwining, per l’aer perso, in mauve, in purple, quella pacifica oriafiamma, gold of oriflamme, di rimirar fè più ardenti. He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people. He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on. He says: il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même, don’t you know, reading the book of himself. He says it’s very clever. He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! He’s back from Paris. He’s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow. He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes. He’s Bloom! He’s bringing the programme. He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in. He scarcely looks thirtyone. He’s coming in the afternoon. He’s covered with shavings anyhow. He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth. He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims:
 I’m suffering the agony of the damned. He’s dead. He’s dead, he said. —He’s dead nuts on sales, M’Coy said. He’s dead nuts on that. He searches his pockets vaguely. He see. He seehears lipspeech. He seizes solitary paper. —He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland. He set off again to walk by Stephen’s side. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue. He’s fainted! He’s from beyant Boyne water. He’s getting his pleasure. He’s giving Sceptre today. He’s going to holler. He’s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off. He’s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says. He’s gone. He’s gone. He’s gone from us. He’s gone over to the lying-in hospital they told me. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy it. He’s gone too. He’s got a coughmixture with a punch in it for you, my friend, in his back pocket. He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously. He shaved warily over his chin. He shook his constraint from him nervously. He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. He shot from it two crowns and two shillings. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! He should be soundly trounced! He shoulders the second watch gently. He should have read that before lunch. He shouts. He shoves his arm in a bidder’s face. He showed them the rising column of disks on the right. He shows all that he is wearing green socks. He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips. He sighed aside:
—Ah me! He sighed down his nose: they never understand. He sighs. He sighs and stretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels. He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw. He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street. He sings. He’s in his sanctum with Lenehan. He’s inside with his friend. —He’s in the craft, he said. He’s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. —He’s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. —He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding. He sits tinily on the pianostool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsel’s grace, his bowknot bobbing. He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown. He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:
—Woa, sonny! He slaps her face. He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change. He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four. He slid it into the left slot for them. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade. He’s looking. He slunk back in a curve. He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to speed it, set his wineglass delicately down. He smiled at bronze’s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:
—The élite of Erin hung upon his lips. He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. He smiled on all sides equally. He smiled, pleasing himself. He smiled, pouring. He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. He smiles uneasily. He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. He’s my pal. He snaps his jaws suddenly on the air. He sneezes. He sniffs. He sniffs. He’s no eunuch. He’s no more dead than you are. He’s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he? He’s not one of your common or garden... you know... —He’s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He’s off. He’s on for a razzle backache spree. He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney. Hesouls, shesouls, shoals of souls. He’s out in pampooties to murder you. —He’s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He’s over all his troubles. He spat blank. He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name:
     Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit,
 bidding him list. He sped off towards Conway’s corner. He spits in contempt. He spluttered to the air:
—O, the chinless Chinaman! He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it. —He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice. He springs off into vacuum. He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup. He squirms. He’s quite enthusiastic, don’t you know, about Hyde’s Lovesongs of Connacht. He’s rather blasphemous. He’s right. He’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman. He staggers a pace back. He staggers forward, dragging them with him. He stands aside at the threshold. He stands at Cormack’s corner, watching. He stands before a lighted house, listening. He stared at them proudly, piled stone mammoth skulls. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known. He stepped aside nimbly. He stepped out. He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held. He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam. He steps forward. He steps left, ragsackman left. He’s the backbone of our empire. He’s the grandest thing yet and don’t you forget it. He’s the only man in Dublin has it. He’s the organiser in point of fact. He’s there, all that was mortal of him. He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork. He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water. He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places. He stood at Fleet street crossing. He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:
—They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow. He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props. He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil. He stood to read the card in his hand. He stood up. He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay. He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly:
—Mulligan is stripped of his garments. He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers. He stooped and gathered them. He stooped and lifted the valance. He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suet folds of Bloom’s haunches. He stopped. He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two are they in water? off it and put it neatly into her mouth. He stopped at the stairfoot. He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell. He stops dead. He stops, points at Lynch’s cap, smiles, laughs. He stops, sneezes. He’s traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li... He stretched more, more. He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. He strides off on stiff cavalry legs. He strike a telegramboy paddock wire big bug Bass to the depot. He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy. He strode away from them towards the window. He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word. He strolled. He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand. He strolled out to the doorway. He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay. He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. He sucks a red jujube. He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly. He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. He swears His Highness not His Lordship by saint Patrick. He’s well up in history, faith. He’s well worth seeing, mind you. He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea. He swerved to the right. He swerves, sidles, stepaside, slips past and on. He’s white. He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings. He’s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me. He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply:
—home and beauty. He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled:
—home and beauty. He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you. He takes off his high grade hat, saluting. He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples. He takes up the poundnote. He tapped his chest sadly. He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail. He taps her on the shoulder with his fan. He taps his brow. He taps his parchmentroll energetically. He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup. He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope. He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first. He thinks you’re not a gentleman. He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words: If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days. He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not. He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. He threw it. He threw it on the road. He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman’s knees, calls in a hard voice. He throws a shilling on the table and starts. He thrust back quick Agendath. He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar. He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office. He thumps the parapet. He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no? He told me to be a good son to ma. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker. He told them of the race. He took a cigarette from the case. He took a cigarette from the open case. He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides. He took it to heart, pined away. He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers. He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously:
—Khaan! He took the coverless book from her hand. He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked:
—Is he?... He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still. —He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it. He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it. He tossed the tissues on to the table. He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward. He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. He touches the keys again. He toured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus. He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact. He trips awkwardly. He trips up a fat policeman. He trod the worn steps, pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere. He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock. He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:
—Goodbye, now, goodbye! He turned. He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s face. He turned a happy patch’s smirk to Stephen, saying:
—The disguise, I fear, is thin. He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly. He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart. He turned away and sauntered across the road. He turned away from the others, who probably… and spoke nearer to, so as the others… in case they…
—Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of ruining. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air. He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen. He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. He turned Combridge’s corner, still pursued. He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire. He turned his angry white moustache. He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall. He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand towards the Pigeonhouse. He turned over the smudged pages. He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain’s length. He turned the pages back. He turned to both. He turned to J. J. O’Molloy and asked:
—Well, Jack. He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:
—Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch? He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows:
—Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads? He turned to Stephen and said:
—Seriously, Dedalus. He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat:
—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you? He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up. He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:
—You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. He turned towards Stephen and said:
—Look at the sea. He turns gravely to the first watch. He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together. He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing. He turns to his subjects. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He twists her arm. He twitches. He unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete. He unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences. He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly. He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple. He undoes the noose. He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:
     What is home without
     Plumtree’s Potted Meat? He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm’s nose running backwards over the letters which he claws. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter. He upturns his eyes. He urged me Stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me. to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He’ve got the chink ad lib. He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen. He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge. He wags his head with cackling raillery. He wailed:
—And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean. He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh. He waits to hear from me. He waits while you wait. He waits while you wait. He walked along the curbstone. He walked along the upwardcurving path. He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.
—Very well, indeed, father. He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to Res in Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ. He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. He walked off quickly round the parapet. He walked on. He walked on. He walked on past Bolton’s Westmoreland house. He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side. He walked southward along Westland row. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He walks. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. He wants it changed. —He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. He wants that key. He wants to go straight. He wants to see the files of the Kilkenny People for last year. He wants two keys at the top. —He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. O’Molloy said. He was. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink. He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. He was all their daddies! He was alone. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect. —He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. He was chosen, it seems to me. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. He was drummed out of the army. He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. He was gone. He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written Romeo and Juliet. He was humane and honoured there. —He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. He was in John Henry Menton’s and then he went round to Collis and Ward’s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff’s for a lark. He was in Mrs Cohen’s. He was in the bakery line too, wasn’t he? He was in the Red Bank this morning. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. He was Judas Iacchia, a Libyan eunuch, the pope’s bastard. He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. He was leaning back against the rock behind. He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. —He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals. He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. He was not. He wasn’t in the chapel, that I’ll swear. He was on the Freeman once. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God’s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do. He was overborne in a cornfield first ryefield, I should say and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down. —He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place. He was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it. He was the croppy boy. He was the eldest son of inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. He was their rector: his reign was mild. He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman. He was too young to understand. He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers. He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly. He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. He waves his hand. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish manufacture winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a gorget of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief, tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinner’s and Probyn’s horse, Lincoln’s Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He weeps tearlessly. He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism. He went. He went. He went in. He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel. He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him. He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:
—The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time. He went on by la maison Claire. He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden. He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black church. He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter. He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned its pages. He went very suddenly. He wheels Kitty into Lynch’s arms, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. He wheels twins in a perambulator. He whirls round and round with dervish howls. He whispered then near Stephen’s ear:
 LENEHAN’S LIMERICK
—There’s a ponderous pundit MacHugh Who wears goggles of ebony hue. He whispers. He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already. He will ask for it. —He will have it that Hamlet is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best’s behoof. He will never capture the Attic note. He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight. He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself. He will surely remember. He winces. He winces. He winked. He winks at his audience. He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told. He withdrew his gaze after an instant. He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to. He won’t give you any trouble, Bob. He won’t listen to me. He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked though he was not a dying man. He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met. He worms down through a coalhole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. He worries his butt. He would. He would and he wouldn’t, I suppose. He would be eleven now if he had lived. He would be tall with broad shoulders she had always admired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon three wonderful weeks! and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes. He would go to Buxton probably for the waters. —He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for
.... He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart. He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw. He would not believe in love, a woman’s birthright. He wouldn’t know what to do to. He wouldn’t surely? He wouldn’t take any money either. He wriggles. He wriggles forward and places an ear to the ground. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father’s death. He wrote to me that he was miserable. Hey? He yawns, showing a coalblack throat, and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchmentroll. Hhhhm. Hhhn: burst sideways. Hi! Hi! Hi! Hidden hand. Hidden under wild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. Hide! Hide gold there. Hide her blushes. Hide my blushes someone. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who suffers in us at every moment. High, a high note pealed in the treble clear. High angle fire, inyah! High brown boots with laces dangling. Highclass licensed premises. High colour, of course. High falutin stuff. High grade. High jinks below stairs. Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. Highly respectable gondoliers! Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered. High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants. High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping currants. High School of Poula? High tea. High voices. High wall: beyond strings twanged. High water at Dublin bar. Hik! Hillyho! Him? Him? Him makee velly muchee fine night. Him Satan fleers, Mocker:
            And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters, For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford And in London. —Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. —Him, sir. Him, then Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Hippogriff. Hips. Hired dog! Hire only. Hire some old crock, safety. His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland. His arm. His arm: Cranly’s arm. His articles on Shakespeare in the Saturday Review were surely brilliant. His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit. His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps’s massproduct, the creature cocoa. His back is like that Norwegian captain’s. His back trouserbutton snaps. His bangle bracelets fall. His beaver is up. His Bloom’s logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error? His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck. His boots are spoiling the shape of my feet. His boots trod again a damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. His boyson’s death is the deathscene of young Arthur in King John. His brain yielded. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he’s proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. His breath hangs over our saucestained plates, the green fairy’s fang thrusting between his lips. His brother used men as pawns. His clenched fist at his brow. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. His collar too sprang up. His corns. His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it. His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab. His Eminence Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery. His Excellency! His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus’ greeting. His Excellency the lord lieutenant. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth. His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. His eyes bethought themselves once more. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul. His eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle, a listening woman at his side. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens. His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes. His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins. His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:
—Is there any... no trouble I hope? His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted. His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. His eyes said:
—Not here. His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy lobsters’ claws. His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from Shottery and from her arms. His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. His farewell concerts. —His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. His features grow drawn and grey and old. His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by the boulders of the south wall. His fidus Achates! His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating. His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket. His first bow to the public. His five hundred wives. His forehead veins swollen, his face congested. His foremother. His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air. His friends had all deserted him. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut. His fustian shirt, sanguineflowered, trembles its Spanish tassels at his secrets. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck’s castoffs, nebeneinander. His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand. His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O’Molloy’s towards Stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. His gorge rose. His gouty fingers nakkering. His gouty paws plumped chords. His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine also Talbot. His green eye flashes bloodshot. His gun rusty from the dew. His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket. His hand fell to his side again. His hand groped vainly in his pockets. His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion have to call tepid paper stuck. His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her. His hands and feet sing too. His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips. His hands moulded ample curves of air. His hands on her hair, for instance. His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof. His hand turned the page over. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks. His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded Agendath Netaim. His hat Parnell’s a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb, saying: Thank you, sir, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave. His head aslant he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his trainbearers. His head disappeared and reappeared. His head follows. His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof:
—Don’t mope over it all day, he said. His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead:
     And no more turn aside and brood
     Upon love’s bitter mystery
     For Fergus rules the brazen cars. His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. His heart quopped softly. His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to. His heavy hand took Stephen’s firmly. His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved. His Honour, sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. His horse’s hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death. His ideas for ads like Plumtree’s potted under the obituaries, cold meat department. His ides of March or June. His image, wandering, he met. His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway. His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on. His jokes are getting a bit damp. His justifications? His last lie on the earth in his box. His lawnmower begins to purr. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons. His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us. His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides. His life isn’t such a bed of roses. His life was rich. His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb. His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. His little man-o’-war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. His look went from brooder’s beard to carper’s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned. His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. His lub back: I followed. His machineries are pegging away too. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly, longingly. His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight. His mood? His moral nature is simple and lovable. His Most Catholic Majesty will now administer open air justice. His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode. His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain. His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway. His nag on spavined whitegaitered feet jogs along the rocky road. —His name is Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom said smiling. His name is Keyes. His name stinks all over Dublin. His name was Brunny Lynam. His name was Virag, the father’s name that poisoned himself. HIS NATIVE DORIC
—The moon, professor MacHugh said. His navelcord. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. His next proceeding? His noncorrosive sublimate! His nostrils arched themselves for prey. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other. His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing. —His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience, material and moral. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. His pace slackened. His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. His palfrey neighs. His parboiled eyes. His plump body plunged. His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more. His private papers in the original. His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle. His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves. His quickened heart slowed at once. His real name is Higgins. His real name was Childs. His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you Mrs B. and begged the chance of his washing. His reverence: mum’s the word. His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating. His second course. His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience. His sins. His sire’s milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. His sleep is not natural. His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall. His slow feet walked him riverward, reading. His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly, shadowing Trinity’s surly front. His smile softens. His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse. His son’s voice! His soul is far away. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop. His spectre stalks me. His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. Hissss. Hissss. His Stephen’s mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman’s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field. His throat twitches. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. His tongue clacked in compassion. —History! History repeats itself. —History shows that to be true, inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos. —History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake. History to blame. History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them. His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees. His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly. His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer. His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. His vocation: Mickey Rooney’s band. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful male, melodious:
     Shall carry my heart to thee,
     Shall carry my heart to thee,
     And the breath of the balmy night
     Shall carry my heart to thee! His wallface frowned weakly. His wife, Father Conmee supposed. His wife has her work cut out for her. His wife I forgot he’s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him. His wife will put the stopper on that. His wives in a row to watch the effect. His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions. His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hmmm! Hnhn. Ho! Ho! Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Hoarse commands. Hoarsely. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Hoarse, masked and armed, the planters’ covenant. Hoax! Ho, boy! Hockey at ten, sir. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field. Hock in green glasses. Hog’s Norton where the pigs plays the organs. Hoh. Ho! ho! Hoho begob says I to myself says I. Ho ho ho ho. Hohohohohome. Hohohohome!

Hold hard! —Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees. Hold her nozzle again the bank. Hold him now. —Hold him now, Ben Dollard said. Holding forth. Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Hold me. Hold my stick. Hold on. Hold on! —Hold on, citizen, says Joe. —Hold on, said Lenehan, till I... Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past. Hold your tongue! Hole. Holes in my socks. Ho, là là! Hollandais? Holocaust. Holohan. Holohan told me. Holy fields. Holy ginger, it’s kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! Holy smoke! —Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is landed. Holy water that was, I expect. Home also I cannot go. Home always breaks up when the mother goes. Homerule sun rising up in the northwest. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. Hon. Honest? —Honest injun, says Alf. Honourable wounds! Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. Honoured by our monarch. Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...

Hope she’s over. —Hope so, says Ned. Hope that dewdrop doesn’t come down into his glass. Hope the rain mucks them up on her. Hope they have liver and bacon today. Hope to goodness he won’t keep me here till seven. Hoping you’re well and not in hell. HOPPY HOLOHAN: Good old Bloom! Ho ragione? HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY
 J. J. O’Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held his peace. Horn. Horn. Horn. Horn. HORNBLOWER: In ephod and huntingcap, announces. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon. Horrid! Horryvar, mong vioo. Horse drooping. Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways. Horseness is the whatness of allhorse. Hortensio calls her young and beautiful. Hospice for the dying. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Hot! Hot! Hot and cold in the same breath. Hotblooded young student fooling round her fat arms ironing. Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Hot hands cold gizzard. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Hothouse in Botanic gardens. Hot I tongued her. Hot little devil all the same. Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines. Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison’s. Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Hound of dishonour! HOURS: O, but lightly! HOURS: You may touch my. Houseboats. Household slops. House of... HOUSE OF KEYES
—Like that, see. House of Keys. House of Keys. House of keys, don’t you see? House of mourning. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of pavements, piledup bricks, stones. Houses of decay, mine, his and all. Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know. Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled. —Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. How? How? How? How? How? HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT
 Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman’s spare body, admiring a glossy crown. How are all in Cork’s own town? How are all your charges? How are the mighty fallen! How are the secondhand breeks? How are things? How are things? How are things going? How are you? How are you at all? How are you blowing? —How are you, Dedalus? —How are you, Simon? How beautiful now across the mist of years! How can people aim guns at each other. How can they like the sea? How can you own water really? How come you so? How could you possibly do so? How dare you, sir! How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! How did absentminded beggar’s concluding testimonial conclude? How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile? How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion Molly Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp? —How did he lose it? How did she do? How did she walk with her sausages? —How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe. How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer? How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency? How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him? How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation? How do? How do? How do you? How do you? —How do you do? How do you do? How do you do? How do you do, Mr Crimmins? —How do you do, Mr Dollard? How do you do, Mr Hornblower? How do you do, sir? —How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. How do you know? —How do you know that? How do you sniff? How else could Aubrey’s ostler and callboy get rich quick? However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all. However haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out. However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, alias Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the Flying Dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded. However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part, how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom’s heart. How flat they look all of a sudden after. How Giuglini began. How goes the time? How grand we are this morning! How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance? —How half and half? says Bloom. How happy could you be with either... How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that. How I found the Lord. —How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom. How is Molly those times? How is she bearing it? —How is that? How is that? How is that done? How is that possible? —How is the main drainage? How is your testament? How life begins. How long ago is that? —How long is Haines going to stay in this tower? How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? How long since your last mass? How many! How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon! How many children? —How many children did he leave? How many has she? —How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked. How many have you left? How many miles to Dublin? How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance? How many women had you, eh, following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts, what, you male prostitute? How many women in Dublin have it today? How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys. How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry. How much? —How much? How much? How much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence? How much are they? How much cost? How much did I spend? How much do I owe you? —How much is that? —How much, sir? asked the old woman. How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymornun. —How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun? How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry? How on earth did he know that van was there? How quickly he does that job. How sad to poor Gerty’s ears! How saith Zarathustra? How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer. How she met her death. —How, sir? How so? —How so? How’s that? How’s that, eh? How’s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How’s that for high? How’s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber? How’s that tender behind? —How’s the body? —How’s things? How strange! How sweet the answer. How’s your middle leg? Howth. Howth a while ago amethyst. How the head centre got away, authentic version. How then could you...? How they change the venue when it’s not what they like. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons he was old and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns. How time flies by! How time flies, eh? How to soften chapped hands. How to win a woman’s love. How Walter Bapty lost his voice. How warm this black is. How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison? How was that? How was the irritation allayed? How will you pun? How young she was and radiant Lalage were scarce fair beside her in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it. Hoy! Hozier’s History of the Russo-Turkish War. Hozier’s History of the Russo-Turkish War brown cloth, 2 volumes, with gummed label, Garrison Library, Governor’s Parade, Gibraltar, on verso of cover. Hray! H. Rumbold,
            Master Barber. H. Rumbold, master barber, in a bloodcoloured jerkin and tanner’s apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder, mounts the block. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames. Hufa! Hufa! Hugeness! Huggermugger in corners. Huguenot. Huguenot churchyard near there. Huguenot name I expect that. Hu hu hu hu hu! Huk! Humane doctors, most of them. Humane methods. Human eyes. Human life. Human shells. Humour her till it’s over. Humour wet and dry. Hundred pounds. Hundreds. Hundred shillings to five. Hundred to five. Hundred to five! Hunger toothache. Hungry man is an angry man. 7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. Hunter with a horn. Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Hurrah there, Dix! —Hurrah, there, says Joe. Hurray! Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hurray for the High School! Hurroo! Hurry. Hurry. Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I touched his hand. Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money. Hurry up, damn it. —Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf. —Hurry up with that tea, she said. Hurt my hand somewhere. Husband barging. Husband learn to his surprise. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. Husbands don’t. Hush! Hushaby. —Hush, Lenehan said. Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly. Huuh! Huuh! Huuuh! out of that! —Huuuh! the drover’s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks. Hyacinth? Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something. Hyena! Hygiene that was what they call now. Hynes asked. HYNES: Coldly. Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Hynes, may I speak to you? Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. Hynes shook his head. Hypnotised, listening. I... I. I. I. I. I... I... Iagogo! Iagogogo! —Iago, Stephen murmured. I always thought I’d marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht. I am a fool perhaps. —I am afraid I am due at the Homestead. I am almosting it. I am a man misunderstood. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life. I am a most finished artist. —I am an Englishman, Haines answered. I am another now and yet the same. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. —I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian. I am, a stride at a time. I am a struggler now at the end of my days. I am awfully angry with you. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am big with child. I am caught in this burning scene. I am connected with the British and Irish press. I am dead. I am doing good to others. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I am getting on nicely in the dark. I am getting on swimming in the photo business now. I am glad to see it has not died out. —I am happier than you are, he said. I am in a grave predicament. I am in his son. I am just looking at them: well pared. —I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. I am lonely here. I am looking for that. —I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered. I am not. I am not a strong swimmer. I am not on pleasure bent. I am other I now. I am out for truth. I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast. I am quiet here alone. I am ruined. I am sitting on something hard. I am sorry you did not like my last letter. I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. —I am sure he has an idée fixe, Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes. I am surrounded by difficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by... I am the dreamery creamery butter. I am the fire upon the altar. I am the light of the homestead! I am the murderer of Samuel Childs. I am the sacrificial butter. I am the secretary... I am the Virag who disclosed the Sex Secrets of Monks and Maidens. I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. I am trying to work up influence with the department. I am twentytwo. I am very disagreeable. I am watching you. I am wrongfully accused. I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. I asked before you. I asked him how was all at home. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. I asked that old fogey in Boyd’s for something for my skin. I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I bear no hate to a living thing,
     But I love my country beyond the king. I begin to like them at that age. I beg your pardon. —I beg your parsnips, says Alf. —I beg yours, he said. —I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. I believe in him in spite of all. I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter. I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. —I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. I believe there is. I believe they clip the nails and the hair. I believe you. I belongs there. I bet she’s a bonny lassie. I bet that would have caught on. I between them. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. —I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes. —I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously. I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life. I bring thee thy answer. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. I called you naughty boy. I called you naughty boy because I do not like. I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world. I called you naughty darling because I do not like that other world. I call it A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of The Plums. I call it a sacrament. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist, to give medical testimony on my behalf. I call that patriotism. —I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. I can break them in this instant if I will. I can easily... —I can get it, Mr Bloom said. I can give you a rare old wine that’ll send you skipping to hell and back. I can have access to it in the national library. I can make a true black knot. I can never forgive you for that. I cannot away with them. I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. —I can quite understand that, he said calmly. I can scarce believe ’tis so bad, says he. I can see them. I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year. I can’t look at the point of it. —I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. I can’t remember anything. I can’t see the Joe Miller. I can’t wear them if they are grey. I can watch it flow past from here. Icarus. I caught a cold in the park. I caught you nicely! Ice cones. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. I changed a sovereign I remember. Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. I confess I’m teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person’s something is a little teapot at present. I cooked good Irish stew. I could. I could. I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that voglio. I could easy do a bunk on ma. —I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up:
 Quis est homo. I could go home still: tram: something I forgot. I could have got seven to one against Saint Amant a fortnight before. I could have helped him on in life. I could have said. I could have sworn it was him. I could kiss you. I could mention Meagher’s just to remind him. —I could not leave thee... I could not save her. I could not see. I couldn’t believe it when I heard it. I couldn’t bring him in to hear the discussion. I couldn’t do. I couldn’t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. I couldn’t phone. I could see the bluey silver over it. I could weep to think of it. I cure fits or money refunded. I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown. I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere. I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails. I’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks, man. Idea for a poison mystery. Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the Church Times. Idea prize titbit. I declare it carried. I declare, I was never so touched in all my life. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. I deeply inflamed him, he said. I detest that: so tasteless. I’d give my life for him, the funniest man on earth. I’d go if I possibly could. I did all a white man could. —I did not, Martin Cunningham said. —I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. I didn’t hear it. I didn’t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. I didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother. I didn’t recognise him for the moment. I didn’t see the paper. I didn’t want it to die. I didn’t want to. I dismiss the case. I disturbed her at her devotions that morning. Idle mockery. I’d like my job. I’d like that part. —I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t say. I’d like to go but I mightn’t be able, you see. I’d like to see them do the black fast Yom Kippur. Idly writing... Idolores. I do not like that other world she wrote. I don’t answer for what you may have lost. I don’t avoid it. I don’t believe it. I don’t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper. I don’t give a shit for him. I don’t know, faith. —I don’t know if I can. —I don’t know, says Alf. I don’t know who he is. I don’t know your name but you are quite right. I don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house? —I don’t mince words, do I? I don’t remember anything. I don’t see anything. I don’t see it, that’s all. I don’t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though. I don’t think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. I don’t want Richard, my name
... I don’t want to be debagged! I don’t want to be imposed on. I don’t want to hear any more of the stuff. I don’t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are. I don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. I don’t want your custom at all. —I don’t wear such things... —I doubt it, said Stephen gravely. I do well. I do wish I could do something for you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I’d rather have you without a farthing
     Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden. I dreamt. I dreamt of a watermelon. I’d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. —I escort a suppliant, Mr O’Madden Burke said melodiously. If a fellow gave them trouble being lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the bridewell. —I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion. —If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy, depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both. —If Bloom were here, the professor said. I fear thee, ancient mariner. —I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy. I feel all wet. I feel a strong weakness. I feel Hamlet quite young. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. I feel I want... I feel sixteen! I feel so bad about. I feel so lonely. I feel so sad. I feel so sad today. I feel that Russell is right. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation. I feel we are. —I feel you would need one more for Hamlet. I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls. I felt her pulse. I felt it was expected of me. If ever he does. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face. If he...? If he comes just say I’ll be back in a second. If he considers it important it will go in. If he doesn’t break down. If he doesn’t conduct himself I’ll wring his ear for him a yard long. If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903. If he had smiled why would he have smiled? If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. If he makes any noise here I’ll bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe. If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. If he stays on here I am off. If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call? If I can get away in time. If I catch a trace on your swaddles. If I could get an introduction to professor Joly or learn up something about his family. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle’s. If I could only find out about octaves. If I fell over a cliff that beetles o’er his base, fell through the nebeneinander ineluctably! If I get Billy Prescott’s ad: two fifteen. If I had black glasses. If I had land under my feet. If I hadn’t heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn’t have gone and wouldn’t have met. If I had only my gold piercer here! If I had passed Truelock’s window that day two minutes later would have been shot. If I had poor luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely. If I net five guineas with those ads. If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane. If I threw myself down? If it’s healthy it’s from the mother. If it was it was. If it were he? If I were? If I were suddenly naked here as I sit? If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend. If life was always like that. If little Rudy had lived. If not? If not from the man. If not what becomes of them? —I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work. I forget. —I forget the place, sir. I forgive him for insulting me. I forgot! I forgot... he... I forgot to tap Tom Kernan. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character. If others have their will Ann hath a way. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under general Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. If she found out. If she had married she would have changed. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her. If she who seduced me had left but the name. If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight. If still? —If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold—one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows. If there is a signpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s invisible weapon. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was. If they don’t see. If they were they’d walk me off the face of the bloody globe. If thou didst ever... —If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts. If we were all suddenly somebody else. If Wilde were only alive to see you! If you allow me. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. If you can have them published at once. If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door. If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes like that. If you deny that in the fifth scene of Hamlet he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him. If you didn’t know risky putting anything into your mouth. If you don’t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden. If you do the eyes of that cow will pursue you through all eternity. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume. —If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said. If you fall don’t wait to get up. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant... If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with thirtyfive years of life, nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita, with fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. If you imagine it’s there you can almost see it. If you just follow the atten... If you leave a bit of codfish for instance. If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa’s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go. If you ring up... If you so condescend
     Then please place at the end
     The name of yours truly, L. Bloom. If youth but knew. If you want a little more... —If you want it, Stephen said. —If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb. —If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, look to see when and how the shadow lifts. If you will be so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman... —If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps... I gall his kibe. I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. I gave him all the particulars. I gave it to Nelly
     To stick in her belly,
     The leg of the duck,
     The leg of the duck. I gave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station. I gave you strict instructions, didn’t I? —I get paid this morning, Stephen said. I give you just three seconds. Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention Paddy Kelly’s Budget, Pue’s Occurrences and our watchful friend The Skibbereen Eagle. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me! I got a card from Bannon. I got mummy’s lovely box of creams and am writing. I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers. I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral. —I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm. I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west. I halt. I hate a rotter that’s insincere. I hate dirty eaters. I hate roaming about. I hate stupid crowds. I hate those buggers. I hate you. I have. I have... I have a few left from Andrews. I have a letter here for the press. I have a little private business with your wife, you understand? I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey. I have a most particular reason. I have an unborn child in my brain. I have a pain. —I have a vision too, Stephen said. —I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. I have forgotten the trick. I have his money and his hat here and stick. I have it. I have it! —I have it, Stephen said, preceding them. I have it still. I have just come from a funeral. I have just to copy the end. I have lived. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta. I have money. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest... I have much, much to learn. I have my stick. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you. —I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down. —I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him. I haven’t seen her for some time. I haven’t yet. I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives. I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. I have passed the way to aunt Sara’s. —I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. I have reasons. —I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. I have seen it coming these years. I have sinned! I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is. I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. I have such a bad headache today. I have suff... I have them all on. I have to laugh! I hear. I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me. —I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf. I heard that. I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. —I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan. I hear feetstoops. I hear great accounts of it. I hear he is keeping very select company. I hear he’s running a concert tour now up in the north. I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. I hear them at the piano downstairs. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame. I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father. I heartily wish you may not fail them. I hear you say onions? I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession qua profession but your Cork legs are running away with you. I hold this house. I hope he’s in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night. I hope I’m not... I hope it wasn’t any near relation. —I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public. —I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. I hope that smallpox up there doesn’t get worse. I hope you are going to say a good word for Richard, don’t you know, for my sake. I hope you’ll be able to come tonight. I hope you’ll soon follow him. I hope you will come round tonight. I, I and I. Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach! — III —

 Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. — II —

 Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. I insist on knowing. —I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. I just eh... wanted... I just see a car there. I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. —I just wanted to say, he said. I just want to phone about an ad. Ikey Moses? Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest. I knelt once before today. —I knew he was on the rocks, he said. I knew his name was like a coffin. I knew she could whistle. I knew there was something on my mind. —I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously. I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an earthly. —I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. I know and I am some vibrator. —I know, Davy Byrne said. —I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes. I know him. I know him. —I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. I know his face. I know his face. —I know, Hynes said. I know I fell out of bed or rather was pushed. I know, I know. I know it myself. I know it well. —I know, M’Coy broke in. —I know, M’Coy said. —I know, M’Coy said. —I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. I know not what to offer your lordships. I knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. —I know, sir. I know somebody won’t like that. I know that. I know that. —I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience. I know the voice. I know two editors slightly. —I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers. I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart. —I know you did, Dilly answered. I know you, gammer! I know you’ve a Roman collar. —Il croit? I leave you this to think of me when I’m far away on the pillow. I left the precincts. Il est irlandais. I liked Colum’s Drover. I like that. I like that? I like to break a lance with you, old as I am. I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this. I live in Eccles street. I’ll be home shortly. I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you. I’ll be there. I’ll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. I’ll bring you all to heel! I’ll call later in the day and I’ll take one of these soaps. I’ll catch him. I’ll charge him! I’ll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. I’ll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I’ll do no such thing. —I’ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. —I’ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I’ll flay him alive. I’ll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I’ll get those bags cleared away from the windows. I’ll give ten to one! I’ll go. —I’ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square. I’ll insult him. I’ll introduce you, inspector. I’ll just pay this lot. I’ll just run out and ask him. I’ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. I’ll just wait and take him along in a few... I’ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews. I’ll look today. I’ll make it hot for you. I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. I’ll make you dance Jack Latten for that. I’ll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. I’ll miss him. I’ll murder you. I’ll nurse you in proper fashion. I’ll pay you back one time. I’ll read the rest after. I’ll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. I’ll ring them up after five. I’ll ring them up after five. —I’ll risk it, he said. I’ll rub that in. —I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly. I’ll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. —I’ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. I’ll see you across. I’ll show you. I’ll show you my likeness one day. I’ll soon be stretched beside her. Illstarred heresiarch! I’ll take a glass of burgundy and... let me see. —I’ll take a mélange, Haines said to the waitress. —I’ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said. I’ll take my oath that’s Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. —I’ll take this one, he said. I’ll tap him too. I’ll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! I’ll tell... I’ll tell him... I’ll tell him. I’ll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt. I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you. —I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said. —I’ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. I’ll tell you the right time up a dark lane. —I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. I’ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me. I’ll try this one now. Illustrate thou. Illustration.

 Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. Illustrious Bloom! I’ll wring the bastard fucker’s bleeding blasted fucking windpipe! I’ll wring the neck of any fucker says a word against my fucking king. I’ll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king. I’ll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt. I looked all along the gutter in O’Connell street. I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses sic in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray. I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon. I love old Bennett. I love the danger. I love you for doing that to me. I love you, sir darling. Il vient! I’m a Bloomite and I glory in it. I’m afraid not, sir. Image of him. Imagination. Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried. Imagine drinking that! Imagine that in the early morning at close range. Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. I make no doubt it smacks of wenching. I’m all clean come and dirty me. I’m all of a mucksweat. I’m a long time threatening to buy one. I’m a witness. I’m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance. I’m bloody sorry I did it, says he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside. I’m coming. —I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered. —I’m coming, Stephen said, turning. —I’m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I’m disappointed in you! I mean... I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word. I mean, a kind of private paper, don’t you know, of his private life. I mean as your business menagerer... I mean for singing purposes. —I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. I mean, I don’t care a button, don’t you know, who is killed or who is guilty... I mean of course it’s all pom pom pom very much what they call da capo. —I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense. I mean the opposite of hatred. I mean the pronunciati... I meant only the spanking idea. —I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. I mean to say to fellows like Flynn. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said... I mean, we have the plays. I mean when we read the poetry of King Lear what is it to us how the poet lived? I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex. I mean wouldn’t it be the same here if you put force against force? I’m English. I met a fool i’the forest. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered. I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan’s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half. —I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. —I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. I’m game for that job, shaving and brushup. I’m giddy still. —I’m giving you two lumps each, he said. I’m glad I didn’t go into the room to look at his face. —I’m going, Mulligan, he said. I’m going to get rid of you. I’m going to plunge five bob on my own. —I’m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I’m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can’t get a penny out of him. I’m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes pro rata having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum. I’m hungry too. I’m hyperborean as much as you. I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. I might have tried to work M’Coy for a pass to Mullingar. I’m in a hurry. I’m inconsequent. I mine. I’m in my pelt. Imitate pa. I’m just waiting for Ben Dollard. Immediate silence. I’m melting! —I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... Immense! —Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. Immortal lovely. Immortelles. I’m not a bad one. I’m not a believer myself, that is to say. I’m not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. I’m not a hero, however. I’m not a triple screw propeller. I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. I’m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday. I’m not going to throw any more. I’m not joking, Kinch. I’m not so sure about that. I’m not sure. —I’m off, said Boylan with impatience. —I’m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I’m off that, thanks. I’m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders. I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires. I’m parched. I’m partially drunk, by the way. —Imperium romanum, J. J. O’Molloy said gently. Imperthnthn thnthnthn. —Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as she threatened as he had come. Impervious to fear is Rory’s son: he of the prudent soul. Impetuous fellow! Important work. IMPROMPTU
 In ferial tone he addressed J. J. O’Molloy:
—Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. Improvising. Improvising. I’m quite frank with you. —I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. I’m sending around a dozen of stout for the missus. I’m sick of it. —I’m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered. —I’m sorry, he said. I’m sorry to hear that. —I’m sorry to hear that, he said. I’m stony. I’m sure it’s the burgund. I’m sure of that. I’m sure that Stephen is a very good little boy! —I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said. I’m sure you’re a spoiled priest. I’m swelled after that cabbage. —I’m talking about injustice, says Bloom. I’m the alligator. I’m the Übermensch. I’m the best o’cook. I’m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones. I’m the only one that knows what you are. I’m the Tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I’m thirteen. I’m tired to move. I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence. I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows. I munched hum un thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday. I’m up to here. I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. I must answer. I must get a drink after that. I must get a wash tomorrow or next day. I must give you a shirt and a few noserags. I must go after him. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. I must now close with fondest love
                    Your fond daughter
                        Milly
 P. S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry. I mustn’t forget his letter for the press. I must really. I must satisfy an animal need. I must see about that ad after the funeral. I must teach you. —I must try to get out there, M’Coy said. I’m very fond of what I like. I’m warm, dark, open. —I’m weak, he gasped. I’m Yorkshire born. In. In. In. In a breath ’twas done but—hold! In a cave of the dark middle earth. In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy. In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes. Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye. In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: euthanasia. In a hurry to bury. In aid of funds for Mercer’s hospital. —In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. —In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. In America those things were continually happening. In a moment he reappears and hurries on. In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. In and out of sacks, over barrels, through wirefences, obstacle race. In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome. In a photographer’s there. In a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom Pubb. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn. —In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her cf neckarching cat. In a suddenly changed tone he added:
—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. In a word. In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. In Beaver street. In Bernard Kiernan’s licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street: in David Byrne’s licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O’Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon’s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway subsequently thrown away, advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W. Sweny and Co Limited, dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. Bantam Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the Freeman’s Journal and National Press which he had been about to throw away subsequently thrown away, he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction. In Bloom’s little wee. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. In came Hoppy. In came Lenehan. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. Incline feet forward! In Clohissey’s window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye. Incog! Incog Haroun al Raschid he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack. Incomplete. Incomplete. Incomplete. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. In consequence of defective mnemotechnic. In courtesy. Increase and multiply. Increase their flow. Incredible. In cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. In Cymbeline, in Othello he is bawd and cuckold. In dark corner young man seated. Ind.: Don’t hesitate to shoot. In death. —Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said. Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle. —Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed. Indiges. Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest. In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni. In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters. Indoor: discussion in tepid security of unsolved historical and criminal problems: lecture of unexpurgated exotic erotic masterpieces: house carpentry with toolbox containing hammer, awl, nails, screws, tintacks, gimlet, tweezers, bullnose plane and turnscrew. In drowsy silence gold bent on her page. Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig’s crubeen, the other a cold sheep’s trotter, sprinkled with wholepepper. I need mountain air. I need not mention names. I needn’t tell you. Ineluctable modality of the visible. [ 3 ]
 Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first. Inev erate inall... I never borrowed a shilling in my life. —I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock. I never exactly understood. I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to... I never put anything on a horse. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens. I never saw you. I never see the like since I was born. I never signed it. I never told her. In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all. In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions. Infatuated. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. Influence of his surroundings. Influence of the climate. Influence taste too, mauve. Influential friends. Inform the police. In Fownes’s street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal’s first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown. In gay Paree he hides, Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me. In Gerard’s rosery of Fetter lane he walks, greyedauburn. —In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for? In going by he had blessed us. In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time. In Grimm too, don’t you know, the fairytales. In Hamlet, that is. In haste. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X. O’Brien and others, the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of Charles Stewart Parnell M. P. for Cork City, the programme of peace, retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone M. P. for Midlothian, N. B. and, in support of his political convictions, had climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree on Northumberland road to see the entrance 2 February 1888 into the capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000 torchbearers, divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2000 torches in escort of the marquess of Ripon and honest John Morley. In here. In here, see. In her lay a Godframed Godgiven preformed possibility which thou hast fructified with thy modicum of man’s work. Inhibitory pressure of collar size 17 and waistcoat 5 buttons, two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion. In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm. In his buttonhole is an immense dahlia. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. In his left hand he holds a plasterer’s bucket on which is printed Défense d’uriner. In his way. In Horne’s house rest should reign. In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. In Ireland? Inishark. Inishboffin. Inishturk. Initials perhaps. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper. In life. In Lionel Marks’s antique saleshop window haughty Henry Lionel Leopold dear Henry Flower earnestly Mr Leopold Bloom envisaged battered candlesticks melodeon oozing maggoty blowbags. In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. In loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap, price 8/6, and useful garden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan, planting aligned young firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling a weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the scent of newmown hay, ameliorating the soil, multiplying wisdom, achieving longevity. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy’s path. In Luke Doyle’s long ago. In Martha. In Mooney’s en ville and in Mooney’s sur mer. In motion being each and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging space. In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. In my eyes read that slumber which women love. In my opinion an action might lie. In my opinion every lady for example... In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences. Innocence. Innocence in the moon. Innocence that is. Innuendo of home rule. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. —In Ohio! the editor shouted. In old age she takes up with gospellers one stayed with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask and heard she had a soul. In or about ninety six. In other respects were their differences similar? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. —I noticed he was in mourning. In our confraternity. I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring. In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks. In pairing time. —In paradisum. In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness. In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business. In quintessential triviality
     For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. In Rodot’s Yvonne and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties, shattering with gold teeth chaussons of pastry, their mouths yellowed with the pus of flan bréton. In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it. In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders. Insects? Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal nerve in dorsal region. In Serpentine avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Insert long round end. Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. Insidious. In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. In sleep she went to him. In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise. In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen’s Hotel, Queen’s Hotel, Queen’s Hotel. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos. Insolent driver. Inspiration of genius. In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points. Instance enthusiasts. Instance he’s playing now. Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase. —Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Instead of talking about nothing. Instinct. Instinct. Instinct rules the world. In strident discord peasants and townsmen of Orange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary. Instruments. Insulted. In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how. Insure against street accident too. In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:
 Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand a national immorality in three orgasms by Ballocky Mulligan. Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind. Intelligent. —Intendiamoci. Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Interesting. —Interesting only to the parish clerk. Interesting quarter. Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. Intermezzo. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk. Interval which. INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR
—Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread. In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires. In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S. J., the reverend T. Salmon, D. D., provost of Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. In the cone of the searchlight behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaun MacLir broods, chin on knees. In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. In the dark. In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. In the darkmans clip and kiss. In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters. In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. in attendance. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled, Bridie Kelly stands. In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow. In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. [ 7 ]
 IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS
 Before Nelson’s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold’s Cross. In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art’s sake. In their line. In the lexicon of youth... In the midst of death we are in life. —In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning, as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs. In the open air? In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle. —In the paper this morning. —In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. In the readers’ book Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. In the same boat. —In the second carriage, miss Douce’s wet lips said, laughing in the sun. In the second storey rere of his Bloom’s house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats. In the shadow of the glen he cooees for them. In the shady wood. In the speakeasy. In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor. In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. In the tabledrawer he found an old number of Titbits. In the Track of the Sun yellow cloth, titlepage missing, recurrent title intestation. In the trousers I left off. In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father’s shepherd. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. Into her. Into the. Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality. Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. In vain! In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. Invece, Lei si sacrifica. Invent a story for some proverb. Invincible ignorance. In virtue of a acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided. In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea. In what common study did their mutual reflections merge? In what directions did listener and narrator lie? In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge? In what manners did she reciprocate? In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected? In what posture? In what state of rest or motion? In what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions now coalesced? In what way had he utilised gifts 1 an owl, 2 a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her? In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C.
 What events might nullify these calculations? —... in which everyone can find his own. In white silence: appealing. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and Leonard’s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. Inwit’s agenbite. In woman’s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away. In words of words for words, palabras. In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes. I often saw him in here and I never once saw him—you know, over the line. I often think of the beautiful name you have. I often thought it would be better to have boy servants. I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job. I only heard it last night. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. I only thought the half of the... I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. I oughtn’t to have got myself swept along with those medicals. I ought to have said something about an old hat or something. I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind. I ought to report him. I owe nothing. I owe three shillings to O’Grady. I own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with—what shall I say?—our notions of what ought not to have been. I paid five shillings in the pound. I paid my way. —I paid my way. I paid my way. I paid my way. I paid my way. I paid the rent. I pass. I pass on. I pick the fellow in black. —I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said. —I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. I polish the sky. I possess the Indian sign. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses’ fees, shan’t we? I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? I promise never to disobey. —I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over. I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he. I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. I put a mark in it. I put it to you that He’s on the square and a corking fine business proposition. —I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. I question with you there, says he. —I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused. I read in that Voyages in China that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse. I regard him as the whitest man I know. Ireland. Ireland comes now. Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty. Ireland my country. Ireland my nation says he hoik! phthook! never be up to those bloody there’s the last of it Jerusalem ah! cuckoos. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons. —Ireland, says Bloom. Ireland sober is Ireland free. Ireland’s sweetheart, the king of Spain’s daughter, alanna. Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that. I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W. B. Murphy. I remember. I remember looking in Pill lane. I remember only ideas and sensations. I remember slightly. I remember the famine in ’46. I remember the old drummajor. I remember those tight trousers too. I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he remarked: keep it quiet. I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant... I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form. —Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop. Irish Homestead. Irish Lights board. Irish nights entertainment. —Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Irish volunteers. Ironical opposition cheers. Iron nails ran in. Iron Nails Ran In. Iron nerves. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I’m proud of it. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. I, Rudolph Virag, now resident at no 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin, formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice that I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all times to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom. Is. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said I. I, said the rook. —I saved the situation, Ben, I think. I saw. I saw all. I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker. —I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod’s eye counting up all the guts of the fish. I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders. —I saw it, the editor said proudly. I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don’t... I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money. I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time. I saw to that, M’Coy. I say! I say, Hynes! I say it and I say it emphatically, without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. —I, says Joe. I say so. I say so. I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. I say you are. —I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. Is Cissy your sweetheart? I scolded that tramdriver on Harold’s cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Is coming! Is coming!! Is coming!!! Ise de cutest colour coon down our side. —Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? I see. I see... I see. I see. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings. I see her! I see her skirties. —I see, he said. —I see, he said again with new pleasure. I see it in your face. I see it in your face. I see Keating Clay is elected vicechairman of the Richmond asylum and by the by Guinness’s preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. —I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him. I seem to know the name. —I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid. I seen her picture in a barber’s. I seen him. I seen him do that in Stockholm. I seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I seen queer things too, ups and downs. I seen Russia. —I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath. I see the idea. I see them. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. —I see, the professor said. —I see, the professor said. I see what it means. I see what you mean. I see you. —I see you have moved the piano. I see you’re... Is eight about. I sentenced him to ten years. I shall be most pleased... I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. I shall die! I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson’s fat hamrashers and a bottle of Guinness’s porter. I shall wait. —Is he? —Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. —Is he a widower? Is he bleeding! Is he buried in saint Michan’s? Is he dead? Is he dotty? I shee you, shir. Is he hurted? Is he in love with that one, Marion? Is he in trouble? Is he taking anything for it? I shipped to get over. I should have said when he clapped on his topper. I should like to have it. —I should like to know, he said, which brother you... I should not have parted with my talisman. I shouldn’t think that is the proper word. I should say that only family poets have family lives. I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne. Isis Unveiled. Is it? Is it any good? Is it Bloom? —Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines. Is it Haines? —Is it his speech last night? Is it in the city? Is it little sister Monica! Is it only half fun? Is it Paddy Dignam? —Is it Paddy? says Joe. Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son’s name had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet’s twin, is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway? Is it some paradox? —Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life? —Is it Zinfandel? Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Island of saints and sages! Isle of saints. I slipped. Is lost. Is me her was you dreamed before? I smell the pubic sweat of monks. I smiled at him. I smiled back. I smoked his baccy. Isn’t Blazes Boylan mixed up in it? Isn’t he? —Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power. Isn’t he in the insurance line? Isn’t he simply wonderful? Isn’t it awfully good? —Isn’t it awfully good? —Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein? Isn’t that grand for her? Isn’t that history? Isn’t that true? Isn’t that what we’re told. Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother? I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money. Is Piper back? I spoke to no-one: none to me. I spoke with Mr Keyes just now. Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms. Is she alive? Is she in love with the first fellow all the time? Is she, Simon? —Is she up the pole? I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. Is that?... —Is that a fact? Is that a fact? —Is that a fact? —Is that a fact? —Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam? Is that Alf Bergan? Is that Bergan? Is that best side of her face? Is that Boylan well off? —Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse. Is that Canada swindle case on today? Is that Crotty? —Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked as soon as his bottom jaw would let him, in? —Is that he? —Is that her? asked miss Kennedy. Is that his name? Is that Ned Lambert’s brother over the way, Sam? —Is that really a fact? says Alf. Is that so? —Is that so? Is that the eldest boy in front? Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial? Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? Is that today’s? Is the boss...? —Is the brother with you, Malachi? —Is the editor to be seen? Is the gentleman?... Is the greatest possible ellipse. Is the mouth south someway? Is there anything more in him that they she sees? Is there Gaelic on you? Is this old wisdom? I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I suggest that you will do the handsome thing. I suppose all my books are gone. I suppose each kind of trade made its own, don’t you see? I suppose he’d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank. I suppose I did say it. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour. I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven. I suppose so. I suppose so, father. —I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. I suppose they really were short of money. I suppose we can do so too. —I suppose you got five, Dilly said. I swear on my sacred oath... It? It. I tackled him this morning on belief. ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM
—He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. O’Molloy said, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the lex talionis. —Italian? —Italian? Italian I prefer. It all works out. It asks me too. I taught him to sing The boys of Kilkenny are stout roaring blades. I taught Patrice that. —It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least. It bore the oldest, the first race. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. It buzz, it twanged. It called again. It came nearer up the staircase, calling again. It can’t be tourists’ matches. It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax. It certainly is. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging. It claims to afford a noiseless, inoffensive vent. It clanged. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting. It couldn’t be? It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat. It does. It does her all right. —It does, Mr Bloom said. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe. I teach the blatant Latin language. Item, curate, couple of cookies for this child. Item: was Hamlet mad? Iterum. It fell on the path. It fills me full. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus. It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling. It gets brown after. It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. It goes out. It grew bigger and bigger and bigger. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep. It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor. It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus’ Div. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. It has the prophetic vision. It has vanished long ago... —It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer. I that sinned and prayed and fasted. It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat. It heals and soothes while you sleep, in case of trouble in breaking wind, assists nature in the most formidable way, insuring instant relief in discharge of gases, keeping parts clean and free natural action, an initial outlay of 7/6 making a new man of you and life worth living. I think I’ll join you. I think I’ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. I think it’s a. I think it will be a success too. I think of you so often you have no idea. I think so. I think that yes. —I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork. I think you’ll find that’s right. I think you’re getting on very nicely. I thirst. I thought Alf would split. I thought he was. —I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. I thought it would. I thought so. —I thought so, says Joe. I thought we were bad here. —I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O’Molloy said. I thought you were of good stock by your accent. I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back. It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was. It ill becomes him to preach that gospel. It is. It is. It is. —It is. It is a colossal edifice with crystal roof, built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. It is a funny sound. It is a kind of music I often thought when she. It is albuminoid. It is amusing to view the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess ment of a harassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled pear under a cemetery wall. It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. It is because it is. It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid. —It is, Bloom said. —It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely. It is cured. It is fate. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves. It is haunted. It is immense, supersumptuous. —It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups. It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in Much Ado about Nothing, twice in As you like It, in The Tempest, in Hamlet, in Measure for Measure—and in all the other plays which I have not read. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. It is mine. It is music. —It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said. It is nothing, but still, a relic of poor mamma. It is not perchance a French compliment? It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured. It is now a month since dear Henry fled
     To his home up above in the sky
     While his family weeps and mourns his loss
     Hoping some day to meet him on high. It is open? It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself. It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. It is so melodious and full. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David’s that is Circe’s or what am I saying Ceres’ altar and David’s tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about the alrightness of his almightiness. It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose. It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied Hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre. —It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a swift glance their hearing. It is true. It is utterl imposs. —It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up. It is what I tried to obliterate my crime. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. It lay there now. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute. It’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one. It lowers. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Cœla enarrant gloriam Domini. It might thrill her first. It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible. —It must have fell down, she said. It must not be! It never comes. It never comes the same. It never reaches anything or stops anything. I told her of Paris. I told her to come after eight. I told her to pitch her voice against that corner. —I told him your symbol of Irish art. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. It only brings it up fresh in their minds. I too. I too. I too. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. I too was just. I tore up the envelope? It passed darkly. It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name. It rains dragons’ teeth. It ran as follows: Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile. I travelled for cork lino. I treated you white. It reminds me of Roman history. It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. It represents a partially nude señorita, frail and lovely his wife, as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature, practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. It restores. I tried her things on only twice, a small prank, in Holles street. I tried it. It rose. It ruined many a man, the same horses. It runs in our family. It’s a beastly thing and nothing else. It’s about the foot and mouth disease. It’s a damnably foul lie, showing the moral rottenness of the man! It’s after they feel it. It’s ages since I. It’s a good idea, you see... It’s a great shame for them whoever he is. —It’s a kind of a tour, don’t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully. It’s a law something like that. It’s a lifebrightener, sure. It’s all right. It’s all right. It’s all right. —It’s all right now, Martin Cunningham said. It’s all the same. It’s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality. It’s all written down: he has to do it. It’s always flowing in a stream, never the same, which in the stream of life we trace. It sang again to Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to wait. It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak. It’s a play on the name. It’s a secret. It’s as limp as a boy of six’s doing his pooly behind a cart. —It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said. It’s a toss up, I think. It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out. It’s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me. It’s a way we gallants have in the navy. —It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again. It’s destroyed we are from this day! It’s destroyed we are surely! It’s dyed. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say. It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity. It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses. It seems history is to blame. —It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. —It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said. It’s for an invalid. It’s Greek: from the Greek. It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars. It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six. Its hump bumped as he took it up. —It, Simon. —It, Simon. It simply doesn’t matter. It’s instructive. —It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. It’s in the dogma. —It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward. It’s in the silence after you feel you hear. It’s just that Keyes, you see. It’s just the cutest snappiest line out. It skills not. It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table. It’s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they’re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. It’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised. It slows to in front of the house. It’s my ball. It snapped. It’s nine days today. —It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly. It’s not far. It’s not signed Shanganagh. —It’s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. It soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver orb it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don’t spin it out too long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the etherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness... It’s on account of the sounds it is. It’s only a natural phenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the... It’s only initialled: P.
—And a very good initial too, says Joe. —It’s on the march, says the citizen. It sounds nobler than British or Brixton. It’s Papli! It’s perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. It’s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else. It’s quite simple. It’s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that. It’s she! It’s so characteristic. It’s so French. It’s so hard to find one who. —It’s Stephen, sir. It’s ten shillings here. It’s the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news in the official gazette. It’s the bazaar fireworks. It’s the blood of the south. It’s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life. It’s the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. It’s the droll way he comes out with the things. It’s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight. It’s them black lads I objects to. —It’s them has the fine times, sadly then she said. It’s the moment you feel. It’s the very essence of Wilde, don’t you know. It’s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil. It’s the whole pie with jam in. —It’s time for you, she said. It’s to be repeated in the Telegraph. —It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said. It suits me splendid. Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator’s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora anacoustic, photophobe, numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90
% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine
% marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon. —It’s very close, the constable said. It’s well out of it. It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs. I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes. I turned her music. It vibrates. It was a charming day. It was a crack and want of glue. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. It was a knockout clean and clever. It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased. It was all things combined. It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred. It was a nun they say invented barbed wire. It was anybody’s race then the rank outsider drew to the fore, got long lead, beating Lord Howard de Walden’s chestnut colt and Mr W. Bass’s bay filly Sceptre on a 2 1/2 mile course. It was a peaceful day. It was a pitchdark night. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife. It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime. It was at the royal university dinner. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed. It was dear Gerald. It was down a manhole. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. It was exactly seventeen o’clock. It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets. It was given me by a man I don’t know his name. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. It was here. It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people. It was in a Kilkenny paper. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather. It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record—in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case. It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding. It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. It was muddy. It was my brother Henry. It was my funeral. It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable. It wasn’t her weight. —It wasn’t me, sir. It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and renovated vitality. It was pairing time. It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir. It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir. It was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. It was then a new movement. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. It was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. It was the purest thrift. It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. —It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement. It was too. It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s. It was your ambrosial beauty. It went into his back up to the butt. It will come as a surprise to his grace. It will hurt you. —It will the air do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment. It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms e.g. It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette. It would be like heaven. It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble. It wouldn’t pan out somehow. Iubilantium te virginum. Iubilantium te virginum... Iubilantium te virginum. —I understand, Stephen said. I understand your point of view though I have no king myself for the moment. I understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... I’ve a car round there. I’ve a rendezvous in the morning. I vear thee beest a gert vool. I’ve a thirst on me I wouldn’t sell for half a crown. I’ve been through the hoop myself. —I’ve heard of him, Stephen said. I vowed that I never would leave her,
     She turned out a cruel deceiver. Ivy day dying out. I want. I want a drink of water. I wanted particularly. I wanted that badly. I wanted to get poor Pat a job one time. I wanted to see him, as it happens. I wanted to tell you. I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine. I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth. I want puce gloves. I want puce gloves and green boots. I want Sandycove milk. —I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it. I want to know. I want to know. I want to pop into Lynam’s to see Sceptre’s starting price. —I want to see about that French horse that’s running today, Bantam Lyons said. I want to see the citizen. I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. —I want you to write something for me, he said. —I was... I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico. I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell you. I was at a funeral. I was at Leah, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. I was born here. I was confirmed by the bishop and enrolled in the brown scapular. —I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said. I was, faith. I was forgetting... I was going to throw it away that moment. I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed. I was happier then. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave owing to his carryings on. I was in China and North America and South America. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. I was in my teens, a growing boy. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I was in the Red Sea. I was just beautifying him, don’t you know. I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. —I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said. I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry. [ 12 ]
 I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D. M. P. at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye. —I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in. I was kissed. I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week. I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I was not afraid. —I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I was only vamping, man. I was only wondering was it late. I was present. I was reading a report of lord Castletown’s... —I was showing him Jubainville’s book. I was sixteen. —I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. I was thinking of your landlord. I was told that by a—well, I won’t say who. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms. —I was with Bob Doran, he’s on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons. I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch. I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. I was with him this morning at poor little Paddy Dignam’s... I was young. I wept alone. I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed In darkest Stepaside. I will. I will. I will. I will appear to you after death. I will arise and go to my. I will, by the God above me. —I will, he said gravely. —I will, Mr Bloom said. I will not sleep here tonight. I will not sleep there when this night comes. I will prove... I will return. —I will, says he, a chara, to show there’s no ill feeling. —I will, says he, honourable person. I will see if I can see. I will serve you your orts and offals. I will, sir. I will, sir. —I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. —I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I wished I hadn’t laughed so much. I wish to Christ he did! I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said. —I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe. —I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said. I wonder will he allow us to talk. I won’t go. I won’t have my leg pulled. —I won’t listen, she cried. —I won’t mention any names, says Alf. I won’t tell you what’s not good for you. I won’t trespass on your valuable time... I would deal in especial with atavism. —I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated. I would notice that: from remembering. —I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I’m on the rocks. I wouldn’t be surprised if it was that kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical. —I wouldn’t do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. I wouldn’t doubt her. I wouldn’t hurt your feelings for the world but there’s a man of brawn in possession there. I wouldn’t let my brother, not even my own brother, most lascivious thing. I wouldn’t mind. I would try. I would want to. I wrote last night to Mr Field, M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the City Arms hotel. I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.

—One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid. J. Lambert, Cornelius T. Kelleher, Joseph M’C Hynes, L. Boom, C P M’Coy,—M’Intosh and several others. Job seems to suit them. Jocular. Joe Brady and the rest of them. JOE HYNES: Why aren’t you in uniform? Jog jig jogged stopped. John Eclecticon doubly smiled. John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:
—Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato. John Eglinton laughed. John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp. John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow. JOHN EGLINTON: Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner: with carping accent. John Eglinton’s active eyebrows asked. John Eglinton’s carping voice asked. John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge. John Eglinton touched the foil. John Henry is not the worst in the world. John Henry Menton asked. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. John Henry Menton is behind. John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment. John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead. John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving. John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve. John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every mother’s son don’t talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity women and children cabmen priests parsons fieldmarshals archbishops. JOHN HOWARD PARNELL: Raises the royal standard. John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me. Johnny Lever, O!
 After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided. Johnny Magories. Johnny, make room for your uncle. JOHN O’CONNELL: Burial docket letter number U. P. eightyfive thousand. JOHN O’CONNELL: Foghorns stormily through his megaphone. —John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased. John Wyse Nolan came down again. John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches. JOHN WYSE NOLAN: In the background, in Irish National Forester’s uniform, doffs his plumed hat. John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill. John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes. JOHN WYSE NOLAN: There’s the man that got away James Stephens. Join on right here. Jokes old stale now. Joking apart and, getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? Jolly for the wife. Jolly Mat. —Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Jolly old woman. Joseph, her spouse. Joseph the Joiner? Josie Powell that was. Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. Josssticks burning. Jousts. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts. Jove, a cool ruttime send them. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick’s, George’s and gay Malahide. Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue:
—It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. Joy: I ate it: joy. Jubilee mutton. Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. Judge Eglinton summed up. Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections. Jugged hare. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. 15 June 1889. Junejulyaugseptember eighth. June that was too I wooed. Juno, she cried, I am undone. Just a bite or two. Just a chance. Just a few. Just a flash like that. Just a holiday. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. Just a little wild oats, you understand. Just a moment. Just a moment. —Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. —Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said. Just a question of custom shah of Persia. Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no. Just as well to write it on the bill of fare so you can know what you’ve eaten. Just at the gate. —Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun. Just beginning then. Just beginning to plump it out well. Just Carr. Just changes when you’re on the track of the secret. Just close my eyes a moment. Just compare for instance those others. Just copy out of paper. Just C. P. M’Coy will do. —Just cut it out, will you? Just down there in Conway’s we were. Just for a few

     Cuckoo. Just going to write. Just had a wash and brushup. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Justice. Justice it means but it’s everybody eating everyone else. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered:
—Dedalus. Just I was looking... Just keeping alive. —Just keeping alive, M’Coy said. Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. Just like old times. Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip. Just look through it. Just missed that by a hair. Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological. Just my infernal luck, curse it. Just nice time to walk to Artane. —Just one moment. Just one word more. Just: quietly: husband. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. Just say in the most natural tone: when I was in Paris; boul’ Mich’, I used to. Just that moment I was thinking. Just the place too. Just there. Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up. Just to see: before: dressing. Just went as far as turn back. Just what you say. Just you give it a fair trial. Just you try it on. K. 11.

Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses. 
 Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen. Katey asked. Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:
—And what’s in this? Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs:
—A good job we have that much. Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes. Kay ee double ell. Kay ee double ell wy. Keekeereekee! Keen glance you gave her. Keep a bit in an envelope.

Kept her voice up to the very last. Kernan. Kerwan’s mushroom houses built of breeze. KEVIN EGAN: H’lo! Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o’-day boy’s hat signs to Stephen. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers smeared with printer’s ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his white. Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. Keyes, you remember? Keyes, you see. Keys: like Keyes’s ad: no fear of anyone getting out. Khaki Hamlets don’t hesitate to shoot. Kicked about like snuff at a wake. Kidney pie. Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray. Kildare street club toff. Kilkenny... Kilkenny People? Kill! Kill! Killing simply.

KITTY: And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn’t swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral. KITTY: Chewing. KITTY: Coughs behind her hand. Kitty, disconcerted, coats her teeth with the silver paper. KITTY: Don’t be too hard on her, Mr Bello. KITTY: From the sofa. KITTY: Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot. KITTY: Jumps up. KITTY-KATE: I forgot myself. KITTY: Laughing. Kitty leans over Zoe’s neck. KITTY: No! KITTY: No, me. KITTY: Peers at the gasjet. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and, gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. KITTY: Wait. Klook. Klook. Klook. Klook Klook Klook. Klook Klook Klook. Klook Klook Klook. K.M.A.

 A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips. Kyrios! —Lablache, said Father Cowley.

Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Ladies find Wonderworker especially useful, a pleasant surprise when they note delightful result like a cool drink of fresh spring water on a sultry summer’s day.

Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental. Lady Bloom accepts no presents. Lady Cairns of Swansea run into by the Mona which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she’d buy a view of Dublin. Lady in the case.

Last lap. Last lap! Last look at mirror always before she answers the door. Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come. Last night I flew. Last of his name and race. Last of my race. Last rose Castile of summer left bloom I feel so sad alone. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.

Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses happily too familiar to need recalling here A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.

Lenehan and Mr O’Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney’s. Lenehan announced gladly:
—The Rose of Castile. Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice. Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:
—Madam, I’m Adam. Lenehan came forward. Lenehan cried. Lenehan cried, running to the window. Lenehan extended his hands in protest. Lenehan gave a loud cough. Lenehan gets some good ones. Lenehan gulped to go. Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him:
—See the conquering hero comes. LENEHAN: Ho! Lenehan in yachtsman’s cap and white shoes officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan’s coat shoulder. Lenehan laughed. Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said:
—Silence for my brandnew riddle! Lenehan linked his arm warmly. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying:
—Muchibus thankibus. Lenehan opened most genial arms. LENEHAN: Plagiarist! Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues. Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round. Lenehan said. Lenehan said. Lenehan said to all:
—Silence! Lenehan’s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy. Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan’s elbowsleeve. LENEHAN: Smells gleefully. Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce’s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled. Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter. Lenehan’s yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Lenehan walked on again. Lenehan wept with a little noise.

Let him take that in first. Let it go. Let me. Let me. —Let me alone, says he. Let me be and let me live. Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I’m after having the father and mother of a bating. Let me be the first to. —Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze. Let me go. Let me off this once. Let me on him now. Let me parturiate! —Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour.

Lips laughing. —Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. Liquor, what? Lir’s loneliest daughter. List! List! Listen. Listen. Listen. Listen! Listen. Listen. Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Listener, S. E. by E.: Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of latitude, N., and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45° to the terrestrial equator. Listening, he heard her voice:
—Come, come, pussy. —Listen! she bade him. Listen: the man. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I’ll thank you and the marriages. Listen to this, will you? List, list, O list! Liszt’s rhapsodies. Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. —Literature, the press. Litigation. Little. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spades, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter. Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney’s snug, squeezed up with the laughing. Little Alf was knocked bawways. Little dog, die. Little father! Little hand it was: now big. Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all
     Went out for to play ball. Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh? Little monkeys common as ditchwater. Little paps to begin with. Little piece of steel iron. Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Little wind piped wee. Live axle drives are souped. Live by their wits. Live for ever practically. Live on fish, fishy flesh they have, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Liver and bacon. Liver and kidney. Liverpool boat long gone. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme. Live us again. Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits. Living on the fat of the land. Living to spite them. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. —’lldo! cried Father Cowley. —L, Mr Bloom said. Lo! Loam, what is this that is? Loans by post on easy terms. Lobbing about waiting for him. Lobster and mayonnaise. Lobsters boiled alive. Local colour. Lockhart’s Life of Napoleon cover wanting, marginal annotations, minimising victories, aggrandising defeats of the protagonist. Lockjaw. Locks and keys! Locomotor ataxy. —Lo, Joe, says I. Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland’s westward welkin. Lollipop. London? London’s burning, London’s burning! London’s teapot and I’m simply teapot all over me! —Long ago? Long ago I was a king
     Now I do this kind of thing
     On the wing, on the wing! Long and the short of it. Long cold upper lip. Long day I’ve had. Longer in dying call. Longest way round is the shortest way home. Longfelt want. LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND: Without looking up from their notebooks. Longindying call. Longing to get the fright of their lives. Long in the tooth and superfluous hair. Long John. Long John. Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips. Long John Fanning could not remember him. Long John Fanning made no way for them. LONG JOHN FANNING: Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance. Long John is backing him, they say. Long live life! Long long long rest. Long, short and long. —Longworth and M’Curdy Atkinson were there... —Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory. Longworth will give it a good puff in the Express. Look. Look... Look! Look at all the things they can learn to do. Look at Bantam’s flowers. Look at here. Look at here. —Look at here, he said turning. Look at him. —Look at him, says he. Look at his head. Look at his mouth. Look at it other way round. Look at me. —Look at that now, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Look at them. Look at the woebegone walk of him. —Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you’ll kick. Look at the young scamps after him. Look at this long candle. Look at this, says he. Look at what I’m standing drinks to! —Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! Look clock. Look down at her ring to find an excuse. Looked?... Looked enough. Looked round. Looked shut. Look for something I. Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money. Look here. —Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the Mail office. Looking at me, the sheet up to her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my cuffs. Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. Looking away now. Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream. Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls, gulls. Looking for grub. Looking for something lost in a past life. Looking for trouble. Looking from Buena Vista. Looking out over the sea she told me. Looking up again he set them free. Looking up from the back garden. Look in here. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look at us. Look on this picture then on that. Look out. Look out for squalls. Looks a fright in the day. Looks as good as new now. Looks as if they did it for a bet. Looks full up of bad gas. Look sharp and you’ll catch him. Looks horrid open. Looks like a phantom ship. Look slippery. Looks mangled out: had a good tuck in. Looks she too not other now? Looks so forlorn. Look straight in her eyes. Look, there’s all I have. Look to our steeds. Look to the west. Look under the bed for what’s not there. Loosen his boots. Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet. Loose tobaccoshreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Lord! Lord! Lord! Lord Howard de Walden’s. Lord Howard de Walden’s Zinfandel M. Cannon 2. Lord, I am wet. Lord, I mustn’t lilt here. Lord, is he going to attack me? Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. Lord Jesus? Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise. Lord knows what concoction. Lord knows where they are gone. Lord lieutenant. —Lord love a duck, he said. Lord mayor had his eye on her too. Lord mayor of Dublin! Lord Salisbury? Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. LORD TENNYSON: Gentleman poet in Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh. Lose it out of that pocket. Lose your customers that way. Losing heart. Lost. LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED
—We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Lost her husband. Lost it. Loth to irk in Horne’s hall hat holding the seeker stood. Lot of babies she must have helped into the world. Lot of ground he must cover in the day. Lot of thanks I get. Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains. Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through illclosed curtains with poor papa’s operaglasses: The wanton ate grass wildly. Lotus ladies tend them i’the eyes, their pineal glands aglow. Loud. Loudly. Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Lou heap good man. Louis H. Victory. —Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding. —Love! Love. Love among the tombstones. Love and laud him: me no more. —Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. Love and War someone is. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Love entanglement. Love is the name? Love laughs at locksmiths. Loveless, landless, wifeless. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we die. Love loves to love love. —Lovely! Lovely! Lovely. Lovely air. Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. Lovely name you have. Lovely seaside girls. Lovely shame. Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. —Lovely weather, sir. Lovely weather we’re having. Lovemaking damages. Lovemaking in Irish, £ 200 damages. Love me. Love me not. Love, moya! Love one another. Love or burgundy. Love or money. Lovephiltres. Lover, for her love he prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under the walls of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward in the fog. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he kills the real Carmen. Lovers: yum yum. —Love, says Bloom. Love’s bitter mystery. Love’s old sweet song. Love’s old sweet song. Love’s
     Old
     Sweet
     Song
     Comes lo-ove’s old... Love’s old sweet sonnez la gold. Love that dare not speak its name. Love that is singing: love’s old sweet song. Love, yes. Lovey lovekin. Love your neighbour. Low. Low blackguardism! Low in dark middle earth. Low sank the music, air and words. Loyal to a lost cause. Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution, the upholding of the letter of the law common, statute and law merchant against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.

Lumpmusic. Lump of love. Luncheon interval. Luring. Lycopodium. Lydia, admired, admired. LYDIA DOUCE: Her mouth opening. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse unsqueaked a ray of hopk. Lying out on the strand all day. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Lynch! LYNCH: Across the world for a wife. LYNCH: All one and the same God to her. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will. LYNCH: Ba! Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. LYNCH: Calls from the hearth. LYNCH: Damn your yellow stick. LYNCH: Deeply. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute? LYNCH: Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty’s waist, adds his head to the group. LYNCH: Handing her coins. LYNCH: He is. LYNCH: He likes dialectic, the universal language. Lynch, his jockeycap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face. LYNCH: Hoopla! LYNCH: I hope you gave the good father a penance. LYNCH: I’m not looking
 ZOE: Makes sheep’s eyes. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano. LYNCH: Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice. LYNCH: Laughs. LYNCH: Let him alone. LYNCH: Lifting Kitty from the table. Lynch lifts the curled catterpillar on his wand. Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. LYNCH: Points. LYNCH: Pommelling on the sofa. LYNCH: Pornosophical philotheology. Lynch puts on her hat. LYNCH: Rushes forward and seizes Stephen’s hand. Lynch scares it with a kick. LYNCH: Sheet lightning courage. LYNCH: So that? Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearthrug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. LYNCH: Three wise virgins. Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table. LYNCH: Tossing a cigarette on to the table. LYNCH: Vive le vampire! LYNCH: Watching him. LYNCH: Which is the jug of bread? LYNCH: With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Lynx eye. LYSTER: In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly. Lyum! 
—Ma! Ma! —Ma ascolta! Maas was the boy. Machines. Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Machree, macruiskeen. —Macintosh. Mackerel they called me. Mac Somebody. Madame: smiling. Madam, excuse me. Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir. Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant... Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. Madden back Madden’s a maddening back. Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name: Lenehan as much more. Madden, T. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D. Leop. Made a big deal on Coates’s shares. Made him feel a bit peckish. Made me feel so young. Made me laugh to see. Made up for that tramdriver this morning. Mad Fanny and his other sister Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness. Ma, dia retta a me. Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together. Maeterlinck says: If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep. Magdalen asylum. MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A. E.’s leg. Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow. Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey’s bowl, exclaimed:
—Boody! MAGINNI: Avant huit! MAGINNI: Boulangère! MAGINNI: Clipclaps glovesilent hands. MAGINNI: Dansez avec vos dames! MAGINNI: The poetry of motion, art of calisthenics. Magmagnificence! Magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun, the stars. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. Mahak makar a bak. Mahar shalal hashbaz. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. Maidenhead inside. Mailboat. Mais bien sûr, noble stranger, said he cheerily, et mille compliments. Mais nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war, wounds. MAJOR TWEEDY: Growls gruffly. MAJOR TWEEDY: Loudly. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackleplume and accoutrements, with epaulettes, gilt chevrons and sabretaches, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. Make a bleeding butcher’s shop of the bugger. Make a detour. Make a picnic of it. Make a stump speech out of it. Make a summerhouse here. Make hay while the sun shines. Make her hear. Make him independent. Make him smart, Hanna dear. Make it up, please. Make room in the bed. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness’s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley’s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane’s ginger ale aromatic. Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Makes you feel young. Makes you want to sing after. Make their own use of everything. Make them accomplices. Make themselves thoroughly at home. Make you buy what he wants to sell. Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes. Making his day’s stations, the dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the Montmartre lair he sleeps short night in, rue de la Goutte-d’Or, damascened with flyblown faces of the gone. Making his rounds. Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased. Malachi Mulligan is coming too. Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish. Male impersonator. Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours? —Mallarmé, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. —Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Mamma! Mamma! Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. Ma mère m’a mariée. Man all tattered and torn that married a maiden all forlorn. MANANAUN MACLIR: With a voice of waves. Man and woman, love, what is it? —Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. Mankind is incorrigible. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. Manna. Manner of Oxenford. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman’s fat yadgana. Man’s head found in a garden. Mansmell, I mean. Mantailored with selfcovered buttons. Mantamer! Manufactured by George Plumtree, 23 Merchants’ quay, Dublin, put up in 4 oz pots, and inserted by Councillor Joseph P. Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries of deceases. Manx cat! Many. —Many a good man’s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh. Many a good one he told himself. Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name H. M. S. Belleisle printed on both. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Many errors, many failures but not the one sin. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson’s Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness’s brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gasovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys. M. A. P. Mainly all pictures. —M’appari, Simon, Father Cowley said. Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest. March! Mare on form hot order. —Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost. Marion. Marion... MARION: He ought to feel himself highly honoured. MARION: Let him look, the pishogue! MARION: Nebrakada! MARION: Softly. MARION: So you notice some change? MARION’S VOICE: Hoarsely, sweetly, rising to her throat. MARION: Ti trema un poco il cuore? MARION: Welly? Mark for a softnosed bullet. Mark me now. —Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. Mark of the beast. Mark this farther and remember. Mark time. Marriage ads they never try to beautify. Married. Married. Married, I see. Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom. Married too. —Married to the greasy nose! she yelled. Marry in May and repent in December. Marry, I wanted it. Marshall’s dark horse Sir Hugo captured the blue ribband at long odds. Martello you call it? Martha! —Martha! Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you... Martha, chestnote, return! Martha it is. Martha, Mary. Martha, she. MARTHA: Sobbing behind her veil. Martha, the bath, funeral, house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus’ song. MARTHA: Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing. Martin asked me to go to the house. Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it. Martin Cunningham asked. Martin Cunningham asked. Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase. Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs. Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Martin Cunningham cried. Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back. Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely. [ 6 ]
 Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Martin Cunningham forgot to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through. MARTIN CUNNINGHAM: Gazes on her, impassive. Martin Cunningham in bed, Jack Power in bed, Simon Dedalus in bed, Ned Lambert in bed, Tom Kernan in bed, Joe Hynes in bed, John Henry Menton in bed, Bernard Corrigan in bed, Patsy Dignam in bed, Paddy Dignam in the grave. Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power. Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee. Martin Cunningham said. Martin Cunningham said. Martin Cunningham said piously. Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute. Martin Cunningham said shortly. Martin Cunningham’s large eyes. Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance. Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace. Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:
—Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard. Martin Cunningham whispered:
—I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom. —Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane. Martin laying down the law. Mary Anderson is up there now. Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. MARY DRISCOLL: Excitedly. MARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am. MARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. MARY DRISCOLL: Indignantly. MARY DRISCOLL: Scornfully. Mary, Martha. Mason, I think: not sure. Massage. Massboy. Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the King. Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors. Mass seems to be over. Master! Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned. Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand. Mastering his troubled breath, he said:
—I’ll take this one. Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. Masterly rendition. Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. MASTIANSKY AND CITRON: Belial! —Ma, sul serio, eh? Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now. Matcham often thinks the laughing witch. Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy, Hetty. Mat Dillon’s long ago. Material domination. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don’t know him poor fellow, he’s laid up for the past week and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home... Maud Gonne, beautiful woman, La Patrie, M. Millevoye, Félix Faure, know how he died? Maud Gonne’s letter about taking them off O’Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Maul her a bit. Maunder on for hours, talking to himself or the other fellow blowing the bellows. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle. Maximilian Karl O’Donnell, graf von Tirconnell in Ireland. Maximum the second. May Allah the Excellent One your soul this night ever tremendously conserve. May as well get her sympathy. May be for months and may be for never. Maybe he understands what I. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife. Maybe now. —Maybe so, says Joe. Maybe the women’s fault also. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? —May I? he said. —May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly. May I tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat? May I trespass on your valuable space. Mayonnaise I poured on the plums thinking it was custard. May the God above
     Send down a dove
     With teeth as sharp as razors
     To slit the throats
     Of the English dogs
     That hanged our Irish leaders. May the good God bless him! May the twentysecond. May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way. May your shadow never grow less. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. McCann, one guinea. M’Coy. M’Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble. M’Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses’ sombre office, then at O’Neill’s clock. M’Coy said. M’Coy’s changed voice said. M’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. M’Coy valise. M. Drumont, famous journalist, Drumont, know what he called queen Victoria? M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. Me? Me. —Me! Me? Me? Me? Me. Me. Me. Me? Meade’s timberyard. Meade’s yard. Mead of our fathers for the Übermensch. Mean bloody scut. Means something, language of flow. Meant nothing. Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy accouchement. Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius alpha in Canis Maior 10 lightyears 57,000,000,000,000 miles distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity. Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Meet you knocking around. Megeggaggegg! Meh. Me have a nice pace. Me in his eyes. Melancholy God! Melting breast ointments for him! Me, Magee and Mulligan. Member for College green. Member of the corporation too. MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED
—North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. —Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market. Memories beset his brooding brain. Memory! Me nantee saltee. Mendicancy: that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1/4d in the £, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated bailiff’s man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella. Men like that. Men, men, men. Men’s arms frankly round their stunted forms. Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Men trampling down women and children. Men wondered. Mercadante: seven last words. Merci. Merci. Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. Mercurial Malachi. Mercurial Malachi! Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he’d have left him for dead. Mercy on the luckless! Mere fact of music shows you are. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. —Merrion square style. Mervyn Browne. —Me? says Alf. Me see. Meseems it dureth overlong. Meshuggah. MESIAS: To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings. Me sits there with his augur’s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar. Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word. Messiah! Messrs Callan, Coleman. Messrs Pick and Pocket have power of attorney. Metaphysics in Mecklenburgh street! —Metempsychosis? Metempsychosis. —Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. —Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. Met her once in the park. Met him pike hoses. Met him pike hoses. Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her about the transmigration. —Met him what? he asked. Method in his madness. Methodist husband. Meyerbeer. —Mezzo. Mezzo sovrano più... M.
 Fifteen yesterday. Mgr M’Manus, V. G.; the rev. —M’Guinness’s. —Miaow! he said in answer. MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH: Pours a cruse of hairoil over Bloom’s head. Michaelmas goose. Midnight chimes from distant steeples. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Might be all feeding on tabloids that time. Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin’s barn a blind. Might be happy all the same that way. Might be his house. Might be money. Might be settling my braces. Might be still up. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Might be the one bit me, come back to see. Might be what you like, till you hear the words. Might chance on a pair in the railway lost property office. Might get piles myself. Might go first himself. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Might have made a worse fool of myself however. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Might he become a gentleman farmer of field produce and live stock? Might just walk into her here. Might learn to play. Might manage a sketch. Might meet a robber or two. Might remain. Might stop him giving credit another time. Might take an objection. Might take a trip down there. Might work a press pass. Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin. Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. Miles of ears of porches. Miles of it unreeled. —Milk for the pussens, he said. Milly. Milly. Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her blue scarf in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide. Milly delighted with Molly’s new blouse. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing. Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know. MILLY: My! Milly, no sign of funk. Milly no taste. Milly served me that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Milly’s tubbing night. Milly too. Milly too rock oil and flour. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Milly was a kiddy then. Milly young student. MINA KENNEDY: Her eyes upturned. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent. Mina Kennedy served. Mina loved that song. —Mina Purefoy? she said. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed groaning to have a child tugged out of her. Mind! Mind C. K. doesn’t pile it on. —Mind, Joe, says I. Mind Maggy doesn’t pawn it on you. Mind till I see. ... mind who you’re pinching... are you staying the night or a short time?... who did?... you’re a liar, excuse me... the gentleman paid down like a gentleman... drink... it’s long after eleven. Mind you don’t get one bang on the ear. —Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed. Mind your cornflowers. Mind your steps there. Mine. Mine host bowed again as he made answer:
—What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish? Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mine too. Minette? —Mine would be often empty, Stephen said. Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere. Minor chord comes now. —M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. Minuet of Don Giovanni he’s playing now. Mirage. Mirror there. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Mirus bazaar. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. Misconduct of society belle. Misery! Misery! Misery. Miss bronze unbloused her neck. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:
—And your other eye! Miss Douce composed her rose to wait. Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey’s tone:
—For your what? says he. Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell. Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest. Miss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not believe: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first: gent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell: the tank. Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away. Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high. Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and eau de Nil. Miss Douce’s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight. Miss Douce took Boylan’s coin, struck boldly the cashregister. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside. Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased. Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:
—16 June 1904. 
 Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter. Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Missionary to Europe after fiery Columbanus. Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled. Miss Kennedy passed their way flower, wonder who gave, bearing away teatray. Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:
—O, don’t remind me of him for mercy’ sake! Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear. Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving, coral lips, at first, at second. Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again:
—Don’t let me think of him or I’ll expire. Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Miss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankard one. Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page:
—No. Mistake must be: someone else. Mistaken identity. Mistake of nature. Mistake to hit back. Mister Knowall. Misters very selects for is pleasure must to visit heaven and hell show with mortuary candles and they tears silver which occur every night. Mistress! Mi trema un poco il. Mity cheese. —Mkgnao! —Mm, Mr Bloom said. Mnemo? Mnemo. Mnemo? Mob gaping. Mocking is catch. Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her. Moi faire, she said, Tous les messieurs. Moi, je suis socialiste. Moist pith of farls of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court the air. Moisture about gives long sight perhaps. Molecules all change. Molesworth street is opposite. Moll! Moll... Molly. Molly. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing. Molly and Josie Powell. Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed. Molly and Mrs Moisel. Molly did laugh when he went out. Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. Molly fondling him in her lap. Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking. Molly had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs. Molly, he. Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show. Molly in Citron’s basketchair. Molly in her shift in Lombard street west, hair down. Molly in quis est homo: Mercadante. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens. Molly looks out of plumb. Molly often told me feel things a ton weight. Molly’s best friend! Molly spitting them out. Molly tasting it, her veil up. Molly, that hurdygurdy boy. Molly too. Molly wanting to do it at the window. Molly was in fine voice that day, the Stabat Mater of Rossini. Moment before the next Lessing says. Moment more. Mona, my own love. Mona, my true love. Monasteries and convents. Monday he died. Monday morning. Money. Money? Money I haven’t. Money is power. Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains. Money worry. Mon fils, soldier of France. Monkeydoodle the whole thing. —Monks! —Monks! Monks of the screw. —Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox. Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets. —Mon père, oui. —Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes before his death. —Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland. Monthly or effect of the other. Month’s mind: Quinlan. Moo. Mooney’s en ville, Mooney’s sur mer, the Moira, Larchet’s, Holles street hospital, Burke’s. Moonlight silver effulgence. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of brogues, worth fifty thousand pounds. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. Moore is the man for it. Moore would say. Moorish. Moorish eyes. Mor! Moral pub. More! More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon. More bluggy drunkables? More dead for her than for me. More genially. More harm than good. More, houri, more. More in her line. More interesting if they told you what they were. More interesting if you understood what it was all about. More Irish than the Irish. More like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish cf mousewatching cat. More power, citizen. More power, Pat. More power the Cavan girl. More put out about a hole in her stocking. More room if they buried them standing. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. More shameless not seeing. More tell me, more still! More than doctor or solicitor. More women than men in the world. Morituri te salutant. Morning after the bazaar dance when May’s band played Ponchielli’s dance of the hours. Morning mouth bad images. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. Morny Cannon is riding him. Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, frate porcospino. —Morrow, nephew. Mortacci sui! Mortal! Mortal! Mortar and pestle. Mort aux vaches, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too. Mosenthal.

Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney. Moses Montefiore. Most amazingly sorry! Most amusing expressions that man finds. Most beautiful book come out of Ireland my time. Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: Sonnambula. Most bloody awful demirep! Most brutal thing. Most deciduously. Most licentious custom. Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting confrères but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs. Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine. Most of us thought as much. —Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. Most scandalous revelation. Most trenchant rendition of that ballad, upon my soul and honour it is. MOTHER GROGAN: Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom. Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann. Mother of Moses! Mother’s deathbed. Mother Shipton’s prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the twinkling. Mother Slipperslapper. Mothers’ meeting. Mother’s milk, Purefoy, the milk of human kin, milk too of those burgeoning stars overhead rutilant in thin rainvapour, punch milk, such as those rioters will quaff in their guzzling den, milk of madness, the honeymilk of Canaan’s land. Mount Carmel. Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. Mount street way. Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Mourners coming out. Mournful he whistled. —Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. Mourning too. Mouth dry. Mouth fallen open. Mouth made for that. Mouth to her kiss. Mouth to her mouth’s kiss. Moutonner, the French said. Moutpat. Move on out of that. Moves to one great goal. Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship. Moya. Mozart’s twelfth mass: Gloria in that. Mr Allfours Tamoshant. Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest. Mr Best asked. Mr Best asked with slight concern. Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague. Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:
—That’s very interesting because that brother motive, don’t you know, we find also in the old Irish myths. Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. Mr Best piped. Mr Best pleaded. Mr Best’s face, appealed to, agreed. Mr Best’s quiet voice said forgetfully. Mr Best turned to him. Mr B interrogated. Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least. Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk. Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. Mr Bloom asked. Mr Bloom asked. Mr Bloom asked. Mr Bloom asked. Mr Bloom asked. Mr Bloom asked. Mr Bloom asked. Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat. Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over voglio, remarked to his protégé in an audible tone of voice à propos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious:
—A beautiful language. Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces. Mr Bloom beheld it. Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the Irish Catholic and Dublin Penny Journal, called:
—Mr Crawford! Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket. Mr Bloom came to Kildare street. Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear. Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head. Mr Bloom coasted warily. Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon. Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does. Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling. Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor. Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power’s mild face and Martin Cunningham’s eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman’s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Mr Bloom inquired. Mr Bloom inserted his nose. Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept. Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker. Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside. Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting. Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing. Mr Bloom pointed quickly. Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it. Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth. Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. Mr Bloom put his head out of the window. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves. Mr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking passed Adam court. Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge. Mr Bloom read again: The beautiful woman. Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand. Mr Bloom said. Mr Bloom said, and I’ll take it round to the Telegraph office. Mr Bloom said eagerly. Mr Bloom said simply. Mr Bloom said slowly:
—Well, he is one of our saviours also. Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink. Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door. Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Mr Bloom’s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks’ van drawn up before Drago’s. Mr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s? no, Sexton, Urbright. Mr Bloom’s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket. Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice. Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably which it was, so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings. Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases. Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads. Mr Bloom stood in his way. Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:
—Simple? Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. Mr Bloom took up his cutting. Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:
—Mind! Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the Weekly Freeman and National Press and the Freeman’s Journal and National Press. Mr Bloom turned at Gray’s confectioner’s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan’s bookstore. Mr Bloom turned away his face. Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness. 
 Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, then of Aristotle’s Masterpiece. Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them. Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed. Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth. Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland’s hearts and hands. Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too. Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard. Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed. Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. —Mr Boylan! —Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period. Mr Byrne, sir, we’ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a... Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs. Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman’s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? Mr Cowe Conacre Multifarnham. Mr Cunningham’s letter. Mr Deasy asked. Mr Deasy asked. Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on. Mr Deasy cried. Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath. Mr Deasy is calling you. Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox. Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers. Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir. Mr Deasy shook his head. Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales. —Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir. —Mr Dedalus! Mr Dedalus! Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently:
—The little nuns! Mr Dedalus asked. Mr Dedalus asked. Mr Dedalus asked. Mr Dedalus asked. Mr Dedalus asked. Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek. Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:
—Yes, yes. Mr Dedalus cried. Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache. Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard’s figure. Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe. Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:
—Was that Mulligan cad with him? Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys. Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:
—The devil break the hasp of your back! Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out. Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back. Mr Dedalus said. Mr Dedalus said. Mr Dedalus said. Mr Dedalus said. Mr Dedalus said:
—I am come to pay you another visit. Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Mr Dedalus said, returning with fetched pipe. Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across. Mr Dedalus sighed. Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly. Mr Dedalus stared at him. Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert’s quizzing face, asked of it sourly:
—Agonising Christ, wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse? Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after
—Irish? Mr Dedalus thought and nodded. Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams’s row. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said:
—Unless I’m greatly mistaken. Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand. Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court. Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach. Mr Dollard. —Mr Dollard, they murmured low. Mr F. Alexander’s Throwaway, b. h. by Rightaway-Thrale, 5 yrs, 9 st 4 lbs W. Lane 1. Mr Fox! Mr Garrett Deasy. Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to... —Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Mr J. Crotthers Disc. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon’s door that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the college lands Mal. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay new for those days, advocating the revival of the Irish tongue. Mr Kernan added:
—The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them. Mr Kernan approached Island street. Mr Kernan assured him. Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser. Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily. Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James’s street. Mr Kernan said with reproof. Mr Kernan said with solemnity:
—I am the resurrection and the life. Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness’s visitors’ waitingroom. —Mrkgnao! the cat cried. —Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly. Mr Lambe from London. Mr Lenehan, yes. —Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar. Mr MacTrigger. Mr Magee, sir, there’s a gentleman to see you. Mr M. Mulligan Hyg. et Eug. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired. Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck. Mr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give? Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on. Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded. Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr O’Madden Burke asked. Mr O’Madden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp. Mr O’Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally’s lunge of his umbrella:
—Lay on, Macduff! Mr O’Madden Burke’s sphinx face reriddled. Mr O’Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the hallway. Mr Orelli O’Reilly Montenotte. Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed. Mr Power asked. Mr Power asked. Mr Power asked. Mr Power asked:
—How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom? Mr Power asked through both windows. Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray’s statue. Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension. Mr Power pointed. Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers. Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage. Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils. Mr Power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone. Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care. Mr Power took his arm. Mr Power whispered. Mr Power whispered. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets’ verses. Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. MRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck’s head couped or. MRS BELLINGHAM: In cap and seal coney mantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzing-glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff. MRS BELLINGHAM: Me too. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up. MRS BELLINGHAM: Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively. MRS BELLINGHAM: Tan his breech well, the upstart! —Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn’t she? says Joe. Mrs Bloom dressed yet? —Mrs Bloom, my wife the prima donna Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated. MRS BREEN: All agog. Mrs Breen asked. MRS BREEN: Eagerly. MRS BREEN: Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! MRS BREEN: Gushingly. MRS BREEN: Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss. MRS BREEN: Holds up a finger. MRS BREEN: Humbugging and deluthering as per usual with your cock and bull story. MRS BREEN: In a onepiece evening frock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph’s diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper, curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20 years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that train again weeping tone once in the

 that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were 2 of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for 3 forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5/- each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore
 who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart sweetheart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though
 no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ 1 or perhaps 30/- Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent 1 or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at 7 1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar 11d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.

Must wheedle her way along. Must you go? Mute. Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Booloohoom. Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Mutton dressed as lamb. —............ my ardent soul I care not foror the morrow. My arks she called it. My ashplant will float away. My ash sword hangs at my side. My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like Hamlet and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn’t tell you. My body. My boots were creaking I remember now. —My boy! My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all, when they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo. My casque and sword. My casting vote is: Mooney’s! My centre of gravity is displaced. My childhood bends beside me. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon. My colleen bawn. My consubstantial father’s voice. My country above the king. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. My dearest wife, Pericles says, was like this maid. My dear fellow, not at all! My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies, dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that il y a deux choses for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. —My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words. —My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. My diggings are quite close in the vicinity. My ear against the wall to hear. My eppripfftaph. My Experiences, let us say, in a Cabman’s Shelter. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. My eyes they say she has. My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! My father gave me seeds to sow. My father is dead. My father’s a bird, he lapped the sweet lait chaud with pink young tongue, plump bunny’s face. —My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes of cent per cent merit for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon’s Studies in Blue, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, 21 June S. Aloysius Gonzaga, sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m. My fireworks. My flesh hears him: creeping, hears. My foes beneath me. My foot’s asleep. My ghost will haunt you after death. My handkerchief. My head it simply. My heart! My heart. My heart’s broke eating dripping. My hell, and Ireland’s, is in this life. My hero god! My house down there. My Irish Molly, O.
 He puffed a pungent plumy blast. My joy is other joy. My kingdom for a drink. My kneecap is hurting me. My Latin quarter hat. —Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Myler Keogh, Dublin’s pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns. Myler Keogh, that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. Myles Crawford asked. Myles Crawford began on the Independent. Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling. Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket. Myles Crawford cried. MYLES CRAWFORD: His cock’s wattles wagging. Myles Crawford said. Myles Crawford said. Myles Crawford said. Myles Crawford said at once. Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace. Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis. Myles Crawford said with a start. Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. Myles, one moment. My lips closed. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. My literary efforts have had the good fortune to meet with the approval of the eminent poet A. E. Mr Geo. My little woman’s down there. My master’s voice! My memory is getting. My memory’s not so bad. My methods are new and are causing surprise. My missus has just got an. —My missus has just got an engagement. My missus sang there once. My more than Brother! My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird. My mother’s sister married a Montmorency. My nails. —My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. My native land, goodnight. My Ohio! My old dad too was a J. P. I’m as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. My own shirts I turned. My painful duty has now been done. My patience are exhaust. My plate’s empty. My poor little pres: p. o. two and six. My present. My real name is Peggy Griffin. My smelling salts! My son. My son inside her. My soul’s youth I gave him, night by night. My soul walks with me, form of forms. Mysterious. Mysterious thing too. My sword. My tablets. My teeth are very bad. My telegram. My terpsichorean abilities. My tipple. My turn now on. —My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, nebeneinander. My whetstone. My wife and your wife. My wife, he intimated, plunging in medias res, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, what do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain’s fighting men who helped to win our battles. My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. —My wife? says Bloom. —My wife too, he said. My will: his will that fronts me. My willpower! My word he did! My youth. —Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper. Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then. Naked wheatbellied sin. Naked women! Name, age, race, creed. Name and address. Name and memory solace thee not. Names change: that’s all. Namine. Naminedamine. Nannan. Nannannanny! —Nannan? says Joe. —Nannan’s going too, says Joe. Nannetti’s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I. Nannetti’s gone. —Nao, tearful Tommy said. —Nao, Tommy said. —Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears. Napkinring in his eye. Narcotic. Narrator: reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the index finger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in the attitude depicted in a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the childman weary, the manchild in the womb. —Nasty bold Jacky! she cried. Nasty customers to tackle. Nat.: Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition? Nathan’s voice! Nat.: Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park? National school. Nations of the earth. Natürlich, put there for you. Naturally. Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren’t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between. Nature. Nature abhors a vacuum. Nature notes. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings notably the maternal, is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Nature woman half a look. Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course. Naughty cruel I was! Naughty darling. Nausea. Nay! Nay, dost not weepest! Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. Nay, fair reader. Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! Nay, madam. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low. Nay, that last play was written or being written while his brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark. Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. Near are lakes. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel. Near bronze from anear near gold from afar they chinked their clinking glasses all, brighteyed and gallant, before bronze Lydia’s tempting last rose of summer, rose of Castile. Near death’s door. Nearer the heart? Near: far. Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. Near Holyhead by now. Nearing the end of his tether now. Near it now. Nearly over. Nearly three months off. Near now. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. Near you. —Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said. Neat certainly. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe. Neat way she carries parcels too. Nebrakada! Nebrakada femininum. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Necessity is that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise. Neck. Neck or nothing. Nectar imagine it drinking electricity: gods’ food. Ned Lambert asked. Ned Lambert asked. Ned Lambert asked. Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps. Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air. Ned Lambert glanced back. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see. Ned Lambert it is. Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:
—The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage. Ned Lambert nodded. Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches. Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s. Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:
—Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune’s blue domain, ’mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’neath the shadows cast o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest. Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. Ned Lambert smiled. Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. Need artificial irrigation. Needles in window curtains. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends. Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state. —Needs! Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude Gerty, surname unknown. Negro servants in livery too if she had money. Neither. Neither knew. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. Nekum! Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Nelson’s pillar. Nephew of the vicechancellor. Nerves overstrung. Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back. Netaim, the golden, is no more. Nettled not a little by L. Boom as it incorrectly stated and the line of bitched type but tickled to death simultaneously by C. P. M’Coy and Stephen Dedalus B. A. who were conspicuous, needless to say, by their total absence to say nothing of M’Intosh L. Boom pointed it out to his companion B. A. engaged in stifling another yawn, half nervousness, not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of misprints. Never. Never. Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. Never again. —Never better. —Never better, a chara, says he. Never built under three guineas. Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. Never find out. Never forget it. Never forget that night. Never forgive you after. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his way up through. Never have written it. Never heard of him. Never in all his life had Richie Goulding. Never know anything about it. Never know what you find. Never know whose thoughts you’re chewing. Never know who will touch you dead. Never know who you’re talking to. Never looked. Never mind. —Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Never pick it out of her. Never put a dress on her back like it. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. —Never read it. Neverrip brand as supplied to the aristocracy. Never see a dead one, they say. Never see him again. Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby. Never see it now. Never see them sit on a bench marked Wet Paint. Never speaking. Never tell you. Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint. Nevertheless, without going into the minutiae of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called Ireland expects that every man and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather. Never went back and the soap not paid. Never would Richie forget that night. Never you fret. New blood. New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed. Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. New lease of life. Newly plastered and painted. New set of microbes. New worlds for old. New York disaster. —New York World, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat. Next chap rubs on a new batch with his. Next item on the programme. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden. Next week, say. Next year in Jerusalem. N. g. Ængus of the birds. Nice adviser! Nice change of air. Nice country residence. Nice discreet place to be next some girl. Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad. Nice fellow. Nice kind of evening feeling. Nice little things! Nicely planed. Nice mixup. Nice name he. Nice name he has. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nice quiet bar. Nicer if a nice girl did it. Nice smell these soaps have. Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Nice spectacles for your poor mother! Nice that is. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume. Nice touch. Nice wine it is. Nice young chap he is. Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. Nicked myself shaving. Night. Night. Night. Night. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Nightdress was never. Night, gentlemen. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks. Night I went down to the pantry in the kitchen. Nightmare from which you will never awake. Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Night of the dance dressing. Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly’s new garters. Nightstock in Mat Dillon’s garden where I kissed her shoulder. Night we were in the box. Nile. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop. Nine lives are taken off for his father’s one. Nine she had. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless. Nip the first rattler. Nix for the hornies. No. No. No? No. No. No. No. No? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No... No. —No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No! No. No? No? No. No! No! No. No. No accounting for tastes. No admittance except on business. No, agallop: deline the mare. No aid was given. No answer. No answer probably. No, ants too. No, a thousand times no. —No, Ben, Tom Kernan interfered. No: better not: another time. No birds. No black clouds anywhere, are there? Noble art of selfpretence. Nobleman proud to be descended from some king’s mistress. Noble words coming. No bloody fear. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody owns. Nobody owns. Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:
—Glass. No bones broken. No book. No born gentleman, no-one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. No bottles! No browbeating him. No, by God, says I. No cardsharping then. No chair for father. No, change that ee. No: coming to me. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne’s or Levenston’s. Nodding. No dollop this but thick rich bonnyclaber. —No, don’t, she cried. No drinks served before mass. No ends really because it’s round. No eunuch yet with all his belongings. No fake, old man Leo. No families themselves to feed. No fear: no brains. No fear of big vessels coming up here. No fixed abode. No followers allowed. No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away. No, Gerty they called her. No girl would when I went girling. No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. No good eggs with this drouth. No grace for the carver. No gratitude in people. No great hurry. No guests. No guts in it. No harm in him. No hentrusion in life. No, he’s a grenadier. No, he’s going on straight. No, I didn’t. No: I.H.S. Molly told me one time I asked her. No insubordination! No, I remember. Noise of the trams probably. Noisy selfwilled man. No: it’s what’s behind. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish. No, I was with the privates. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. No, just right. No kid. No lard for them. No later undoing will undo the first undoing. No, Leopold. No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman’s will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds. Nom de Dieu! No meat and milk together. No more. No more blow hot and cold. No more desire. No more do I. No more letters, I hope. No more pain. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. No more wandering about. No, mother! —No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. —No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes. —No, Mr Bloom said. —No, Mr Bloom said. —No, Mr Bloom said. —No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself..... No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. —No, Ned. —No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught... No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing, a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. None nought said nothing. None of your damned lawdeedaw airs here. None of your lean kine, not much. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey. Nones. Non fromage. —Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine. No, no. No, no. No, no. —No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. No, no: he is dead, of course. —No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. No, no, Mulligan! No, no: not that. No, not alone. No, nothing has happened. No, not like that. No, not tell all. No, no, worshipful master, light of love. —No, now, urged Lenehan. Non serviam! No nursery work for her, thanks. No objection to French lozenges? No offence, Crofton. Nookshotten. No-one. No-one. No-one. No-one about. No-one about. No-one behind. No-one here: Goulding and I. No-one here to hear. No-one is anything. No-one knows him. No-one saw: tell no-one. No-one spoke. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Noon slumbers. No other in sight. No passout checks. No, Peter Claver I am thinking of. No poetic licence. No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss. No pruningknife. No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin. Nor Ben nor Bob nor Tom nor Si nor George nor tanks nor Richie nor Pat. No reasonable offer refused. —No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup. —Nor good red herring, says Joe. No, Richie said. Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh’s library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. No roses without thorns. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. North Cork and Spanish officers! Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian, 1903... North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds. North wall and sir John Rogerson’s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming. —No, said miss Kennedy. No Sandymount tram. No sawdust there. No, say I! —No, says I. —No, says Joe. —No, says Martin, we’re ready. —No, says the citizen. Nosebag time. No security. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Nosey Flynn asked. Nosey Flynn asked, sipping. NOSEY FLYNN: Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance? NOSEY FLYNN: Give us a tune, Bloom. Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. Nosey Flynn pursed his lips. Nosey Flynn said. Nosey Flynn said. Nosey Flynn said. Nosey Flynn sipped his grog. Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it. NOSEY FLYNN: Where do I draw the five pounds? Nosey numbskull. No, she can jump me. No, she couldn’t say. No, she was not so lonely archly miss Douce’s head let Mr Lidwell know. No: she wouldn’t like that much. No sidesaddle or pillion for her, not for Joe. No sign. —No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. —No, sir. No, sir. No, sir. No, sir. No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass. No, snuffled it up. No soft job. No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure. Nos omnes biberimus viridum toxicum diabolus capiat posterioria nostria. No son. No son of thy loins is by thee. No soul will live there. No sound. No sound. —No, Stephen said. —No, Stephen said promptly. No such ass. —No suffering, he said. Not a bit. Not a bit funky. Not a budge out of him. Not a historical fact. Not all there, in fact. Not annoyed then? Not a pite of sheeses? Not a red at me this week gone. Not arrived yet. Not as bad as it sounds. Not a sign. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst. Not a sinner. Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings. Not as much as would blind your eye. Not at all. —Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. —Not at all, says Martin. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. Not a word. Not a word more on that subject! —Not a word, says Joe. Not bad for a Fairview moon. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. Not by a long shot if I know it. Not come: whet appetite. Not completely. NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR
 The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:
—Wait. Notes chirruping answer. Not even a caw. Not even Molly. Not even so much. Not even the smoke. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society! Not following me? Not for nothing was he a butcher’s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. Not for sale. Not go in and blurt out what you know you’re not to: what’s parallax? Not going to be any music. Not going to hurt you. Not half. Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone. —No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. —No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside. —No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go. —No: that book. No, that’s noise. No, that’s the other. Not he! No, the dog. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time. No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing. Nothing. Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. —Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered. Nothing doing. Nothing doing, I expect. Nothing else mattered. Nothing grows in it. —Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said. Nothing like a dressy appearance. Nothing new under the sun. Nothing new under the sun. Nothing on there. Nothing she can eat? Nothing to do. Nothing to feed on feed on themselves. Nothing was said. Not hurt? Not hurt anyhow. Notice because I’m in mourning myself. No time to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of poetry. Not impossibly, with 1 or 2 stripper cows, 1 pike of upland hay and requisite farming implements, e.g., an end-to-end churn, a turnip pulper etc. Not in full possession of faculties. Not in the bed. Not leave thee. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop. Not like Ecce Homo. Not likely. Not like that frump today. Not logwood that. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Not make him walk twice. Not making much hand of it. Not man. Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared. Not much. Not much grief there. Not much however. Not my fault, old cockalorum. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me your valise and I’ll post you the ticket. Not on my breakfast. Not on my own, you know. No touching that. No touch kicking. Not pleasant for the wife. No tram in sight. Notre ami Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there. No trouble. Not saying a word. Not see. Not smooth enough. Not so bad then. Not so lonely. Not so loud my name. Not so young now. Not stillborn of course. Not such damn fools. —Not taking anything between drinks, says I. Not that I... Not that I heard of. Not that I wish it for you. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, with her husband’s brother? Not the least little bit. Not there. —Not there, my child, says he. Not they! Not think. Not this Monsieur, I said. Not today anyhow.

Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful. —Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Not too dusty? Not too much polite. Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O’Shiels, the O’Hickeys, the O’Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux. Not true. Not twenty I’m sure he was. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Not up yet. Not verbally. No, twenty... Not wholly for the smooth caress. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet awhile. —No, uncle Richie... No use canvassing him for an ad. —No use complaining. No use disturbing her. No use humming then. No use sticking to him like a leech. No use thinking of it any more. Nous ferons de petites cochonneries. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29 December 1893 of second and only male issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. No: vorrei e non. Now? Now? Now! Now. Now. Now! Now. No, wait: four. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps. —Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Now could you make out a thing like that? Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Now, don’t tell a big fib! Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment. No wedding garment. Now for your punishment frock. Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons. Nowhere in particular. Now he’s got in with Blumenfeld. Now he’s really what they call a dirty jew. Now he was laid to rest. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be. Now I bet it makes them feel happy. Now I’d give a trifle to know who he is. Now I eat his salt bread. Now if he got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they’d clank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back. Now if I did that at a banquet. Now if they had made it round like a wheel. Now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn’t. Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin. Now I’m going to try publicity. No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Now in the Iveagh home. Now, isn’t that wit. Now it could bear no more. No wit, no wrinkles. Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might. Now, my miss. —Now, my miss, he said. No woman of any wit would wear one. No worry. Now photography. Now silent air. Now that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time. Now that’s a coincidence. Now that’s quite enough about that. Now that’s really a coincidence: second time. Now that was farseeing. —Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising. Now then our glory song. —Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description. Now what were those two at? Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil? Now who is he I’d like to know? Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now won’t you? Now you mention it his face was familiar to me. Now your best French polish. Now, you’re talking straight, Mr Crimmins. No, you aren’t. Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead. Number? Number eighty still unlet. Number one Bass did that for him. Number one swung lourdily her midwife’s bag, the other’s gamp poked in the beach. —Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Numbers it is. Numerous. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can’t get. Nun Trinkst Du die süsse Milch des Euters. Nurse Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a milligramme. Nurse loves the new chemist. Nutarians. O! A bone! O, a few shillings. O, and I forgot that latchkey too. O and that lotion mustn’t forget. O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. —O, an impossible person! he exclaimed. —O, ask me, sir. O, as true as I’m telling you. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! Obligated awful. Oblige him, if possible. O, Bloom has his good points. O’Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. O! Bo! —O, Boylan, she said. O boys! O boys! O’Brien. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. O!
 But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. O, but you missed Dedalus on Hamlet. Obvious analogy to my idea. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation, which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. O, by God, Blazes is a hairy chap. —O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. O by the by that lotion. O’Callaghan on his last legs. Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat. Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. Occupy her. O, cheese it! Ochone! Ochone! —O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. O’clock. O cold! O, commend me to an israelite! O. Course if I didn’t I wouldn’t ask. O crinkly! scrapy! 8 October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. Ocularly woman’s bivalve case is worse. —O, damn you and your Paris fads! Odd! Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets. O, dear! O, dear! O dear, he is Gerald. —O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. O, did you, my fine fellow? O do! O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! —O, don’t be talking! she said. O, don’t they know! —O, do, sir. —O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. O!
 Eh? O’er ryehigh blue. O, ever so gently, pet. O, excuse! O, excuse! —O, excuse me! O! Exhausted that female has me. Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse. Of a different order of difficulty. Of all de darkies Massa Pat was verra best. Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare’s reverence, the angel of the world. Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. —O, Father Cowley said. —O, Father Dineen! O, father, will you? Of Bloom. Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn killed in action, Modder River, Philip Gilligan phthisis, Jervis Street hospital, Matthew F. Kane accidental drowning, Dublin Bay, Philip Moisel pyemia, Heytesbury street, Michael Hart phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital, Patrick Dignam apoplexy, Sandymount. Of course. —Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. Of course aristocrats, then the others copy to be in the fashion. Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though as the event turned out the poor fool hadn’t much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Of course he is dead. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it. Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:
—Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa. —Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot. Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon. —Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one. Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. Of course it might. Of course it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out. Of course it’s years ago. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. —Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the Alice, where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility. Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living. Of course the other senses are more. Of course they understand birds, animals, babies. Of course you didn’t notice as much as I did. Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saint Agatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge. —Off Blackpitts, Stephen said. Off colour after Kiernan’s, Dignam’s. Offend her. Offend me still. Off her beat here. Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Off his chump. Off the drunks perhaps. Off to mammy. Off to the country: Broadstone probably. Off we pop! —Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey. Of good family too would one think it? Of him that walked the waves. O, fie! Of Ireland, the Dalcassians, of hopes, conspiracies, of Arthur Griffith now, A E, pimander, good shepherd of men. Of Israel’s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Of John Thomas, her spouse. Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes. O, flowers! Of me? Of Meyerbeer that is. O, for a fresh of breath air! Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie Richard Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics’ theatre of university College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of his sister Dilly Delia in his father’s house in Cabra. Of Paul de Kock. Of sin. Of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in wonder, a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded, reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life. Often thought she was in the dumps till she began to lilt. Of that house A. Horne is lord. Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached. Of them? —Of the offence to me, Stephen answered. —Of the tribe of Reuben, he said. —Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks with a Scotch accent. Of Wexford. Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him? Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary? Of what in the other devil’s name? Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think? —Of what then? O, get out, you skunk! O, get, rev on a gradient one in nine. —O go away! she said. —O God! O God, I’ve a pain laughing. O God, yes! O good God, take him! O go on! —O, Haines said, you have heard it before? O’Hara’s tower. O, HARP EOLIAN!
 He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth. O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book. O, he did. —O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. O, he dolores! —O hell! says I. O, her mouth in the dark! O, he’s carrying her round the room doing it! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies. —Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face. Oho! —O, how do you do, Mrs Breen? O how I long to meet you. O, I can read your thoughts! O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks. O, I have been a perfect pig. —O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. O, I know what you’re hinting at now! —O, I’m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. O, I must tell you what Dowden said! O, I never laughed so many! O, infamy! O, I see. O, I shall expire! Oisin with Patrick. O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! —O, it’s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. O, it’s hell itself! —O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is! O jays! O jays, into the men’s porter. O, jay, there’s no milk. O, Jesus, he did. O, Johnny Lever! O jumping Jupiter! O just wait till I see Molly! O, Kinch, thou art in peril. O. K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Old. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger. Old Barbary ape that gobbled all his family. Old Betty’s joints are on the rack. Old Bloom. Old Bloom. Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle. Old Deasy’s letter. Old Dr Murren’s. Old England is dying. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. Old Father Ocean. Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox. Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door. Old Glynn fifty quid a year. Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the vibrato: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street. Old Goodwin’s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast. OLD GUMMY GRANNY: Rocking to and fro. OLD GUMMY GRANNY: Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen’s hand. Old hag with the yellow teeth. Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow’s castle on the Nore. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Old legal cronies cracking a magnum. Old man himself. Old men’s dogs usually are. Old Monks, the dayfather. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard. Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling stomach’s Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. Old now. Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses’ beard. Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else. Old shrunken paps. Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold. Old style. Old thieves’ dodge. —Old Troy, says I, was in the force. Old wall where sudden lizards flash. Old Whatwhat. Old woman that lived in a shoe she had so many children. O, leave them there to simmer. O Leo! O, lest he forget. O let him! O, let it slide. O List! Olives are packed in jars, eh? Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation. O, look we are so! O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! O, look who it is for the love of God! O Lord, that little limping devil. O lust our refuge and our strength. O’MADDEN BURKE: Free fox in a free henroost. O’Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. —O. Madden, Lenehan said. O!
 MAGINNI: Les tiroirs! O, Mairy lost the pin of her. O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers. O, Mairy lost the string of her. O, make the kwawr a krowawr! Omelette... O merde alors! O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling. OMINOUS—FOR HIM!
 J. J. O’Molloy said not without regret:
—And yet he died without having entered the land of promise. Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! —O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. Omnis caro ad te veniet. Omnis caro ad te veniet. OMNIUM GATHERUM
—We were only thinking about it, Stephen said. O more. —O, Mr Bloom, how do you do? —O, Mr Bloom said. —O, Mr Bloom said. O!
 Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. —O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. O my! —O my! —O, my corns! he said plaintively. O, my dictionary. O, my foot’s tickling. O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade. O, my rib risible! On. On. On. On. On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield, a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the fieldaltar of Saint Barbara. On another star. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbishtip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. Once a wooer, twice a wooer. Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother’s rest he had not prayed. Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Juda Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his Bloom’s house in Lombard street, west. Once is a dose. Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor’s Walk. Once quick in the brains of men. Once spurned twice spurned. Once you are dead you are dead. On coronation,
     Coronation day! On coronation day, on coronation day,
     O, won’t we have a merry time,
     Drinking whisky, beer and wine! On Dignam now. One! One always feels that Goethe’s judgments are so true. One and eightpence too much. One and eightpence too much. —One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily. One and four into twenty: fifteen about. One and nine. On earth as it is in heaven. One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One body. One body. One born every second somewhere. One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm. One comfort me. —One corned and cabbage. One day in the national library we had a discussion. One dragged aside: an old woman peeping. One fellow told another and so on. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. One flat. One good turn deserves another. One grain pour off odour for years. —Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. One hope. One hour’s your time to live, your last. O’Neill Russell? One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says. One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing. One life is all. One life is all. One love. One man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the natives choza de, another the seaman’s discharge. One meal and a collation for fear he’d collapse on the altar. One moment. One moment. One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure. One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read: Return of Parnell. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed. One must outlive the other. One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life. —One of the best, M’Coy said. One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. One of them lost two quid on the race. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out. One of the old queen’s sons, duke of Albany was it? had only one skin. One of the old sweet songs. One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel’s cap, saying:
—There, sir. One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger. One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas. One of those mixed middlings he is. One of those, my lord. One: one, one, one, one, one: two, one, three, four. One or two? One plus two plus six is seven. One pound seven. One pound seven, say. One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man. One rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de Kock with a loud proud knocker with a cock carracarracarra cock. One rapped, one tapped, with a carra, with a cock. One, seven, eleven, and five. —One stew. One story good till you hear the next. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. One tabloid of cascara sagrada. —One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment. One thinks of Homer. One third of a pint of quassia to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking. One tony relative in every family. One, two. One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone. One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower. One way of getting on in the world. One way out of it. One whiff of that and you’re a goner. One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners. On fire, on fire! On fire, on fire! On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M’Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. On her feet are jewelled toerings. On her flower frowning miss Douce said:
—Most aggravating that young brat is. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered. On his annual bend, M’Coy said. On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail’s bed. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins. Onions. Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. On its cooperative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Onlookers see most of the game. Only a little burnt. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin. Only a pauper. Only a year or so older than Molly. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound. —Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. Only crows, priests and English coal are black. Only five she was then. Only for what happened him. Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother. Only in the halfpenny place. Only I was running after that... Only man buries. Only measles. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge. Only namesakes. Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Only once it comes. ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP
 He went down the house staircase. Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please. —Only one, says Martin. Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Only politeness perhaps. Only that once. Only the chimney’s broken. Only the ethereal. Only the harp. Only the two themselves. Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash. Only two there now. Only weggebobbles and fruit. Only, you know, sensation. Only your bounden duty. On me alone. On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings. On my way. On nags hogs bellhorses Gadarene swine Corny in coffin steel shark stone onehandled Nelson two trickies Frauenzimmer plumstained from pram falling bawling. On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis Xavier’s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram. On Northumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano Artifoni’s sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing door. On now. On O’Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c. O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael. —O, no, Mr Bloom said. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff’s office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. O, no, she’s not here: the flower: no, no. O, not for worlds. O, not in the least. O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him. On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door. On solitary hotel paper she writes. On swift sail flaming
     From storm and south
     He comes, pale vampire,
     Mouth to my mouth. On that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies, naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. On the antlered rack of the hall hang a man’s hat and waterproof. —On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily. On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince’s stores. On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap. On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton’s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off. On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. On the duke’s lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image objection not stated. On the Erin’s King that day round the Kish. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears, flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a sidepocket. On the hands down. On the hands down. On the hands down! On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic violet comfits. On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree’s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co’s white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps’s soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch’s choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one, the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy’s cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom’s and Mrs Fleming’s breakfasts, made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the night of the seventeenth of February 1904 the prisoner was seen by two witnesses. On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner Hesperus and etcetera. On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives. On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others. On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled Sweets of Sin produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table with a pencil supplied by Stephen Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and in the absence of mem a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100. On the pig’s back. On the right smaller hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left larger hob a black iron kettle. On the road to Malahide. On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. On the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand, lightly, plumply, leave it to my hands. On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back reason of change not stated. On the spindle side. On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending. On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers. On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: Naked women! On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse. On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars empty of various sizes and proveniences. On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student faculty and year not stated. On the wholesale orders perhaps. On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the Don Giovanni description and Martha, a gem in its line, he had a penchant, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed. Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. —On which the sun never rises, says Joe. On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy. On yonder river. Oo! Oo. O, O. He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand. —O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. Ook. Oomb, allwombing tomb. O! O! Monsters! O! O!
 Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question. Ooo! Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot. O, O the boys of
     Kilkenny... Open. Open hallway. Open house. Opening her handbag, chipped leather. Opening of his waistcoat. Open it. Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Open Sesame! Open your eyes. Open your eyes now. Open your gates and sing
     Hosanna... —Opera? Opera he’d like? —O please do, sir... O please, Mr Policeman, I’m lost in the wood. O.P. must work off bad karma first. O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! O, poor Robinson Crusoe! Opposite Pigott’s music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. 
 Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket, slashed with gold. Or? Or? Or a change of address anyway. —Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks. Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks... Or a lilt. Or all start scratch then get out of step. Or am I now I? Or a monk. Orangeflower...? Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa. Orangegroves for instance. Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and floor and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray on the washstand, together, pitcher and night article on the floor, separate. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Or any other woman marries a half and half. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Ora pro nobis. —Ora pro nobis, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair. Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Orate, fratres, pro memetipso. Or a woman’s with her saucepan. Or bad? Or because not? Or because so like the Spanish. Or Bennett’ll shove you in the lockup. Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun. Or bury at sea. Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood
     Tears such as angels weep. Or children playing battle. Or cycle down. Order. Order! Order in court! Ordinary meat for them. Or do you are fond better what belongs they moderns pleasure turpitude of old mans? Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. Or do you want to know? —O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up. Or even hear of it. Organ in Gardiner street. Or gas about our lovely land. Or had. Or hanging up on the floor. Or he feels. Or hers. —Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned. Or Hughie Wills? Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting. Or if not? Or is it from her? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Or is it the volume is equal to the weight? Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat ah, that was a day!, already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief not for show only, his case of bright trinketware alas! a thing now of the past! and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging but the heart? tell me! his studied baisemoins. Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps. Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship? —Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said. Or no. Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin. O rocks! O rocks! —O, rocks! she said. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. O rose! O rose! O’Rourke, prince of Breffni. Or, please allow me... Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, parceque M. Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l’avait mise dans cette fichue position c’était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Or sitting all day typing. Or so they allege. Or so they said.

Or we are surprised they have any brains. Or what they say. Or who is he? Or who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head? Or will I drop into old Harris’s and have a chat with young Sinclair? O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! O saints above, I’m drenched! —O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. O, she is... O, she need not trouble. O shivery! —O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. O si, certo! O, surely he bagged it. O, sure they wouldn’t do anything! O, sure they wouldn’t really! O sweet little, you don’t know how nice you looked.

O, that’s all only all right. O, that’s all right. O, that’s all right. O, that’s exquisite! O, that’s nyumnyum. —O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence. O, that’s the style. O, that was a very nice name to have. O. That was very good now. O that way! O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy! O, the fire of hell! Othello black brute. Other chap. Other chap telling him something with his mouth full. Other comedown. Other dying every second. O, there! Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. —O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire. Other fellow did it: other me. Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. Other I got pound. Others abide our question. Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow. Other steps into his shoes when he gets his notice to quit. Other stocking. Other three hundred born, washing the blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling maaaaaa. Otherwise I couldn’t have. Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance. Otherwise you couldn’t remember the face after fifteen years, say. Other world she wrote. O, the thunder of those loins! O, the very man! O, the whore of the lane! O, the women in the front row! O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar! O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt! O, this is too monotonous! O, those transparent! —O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. O, touch me soon, now. Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money? Oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Ought to attend to my appearance my age. Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Ought to be places for women. Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ought to be tough from exercise. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves. Ought to invent dummy pianos for that. Our. Our. Our cattle trade. Our envelopes. Our Father who art in purgatory. —Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Our friend noise in the street. Our gracious and popular vicereine. Our great day, she said. Our greatest living phonetic expert wild horses shall not drag it from us! has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance the italics are ours to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. Our great sweet mother! Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the O’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Our Lady’s Hospice for the dying. Our lovely land. —Our mighty mother! Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he aint saying nothing. Our mutual faith. —Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom apropos of knives remarked to his confidante sotto voce. Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says. Our native Doric. Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s, were partial to the running stream. Our old friend caustic. Our own fault. Our players are creating a new art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Our prize titbit: Matcham’s Masterstroke. Our Saviour. Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. Our sister. Our soi-disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering:
—I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships. Our souls. Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more. Our staple food. Ours the white death and the ruddy birth. —Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said. Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. Our whatnot, our writingtable where we never wrote, aunt Hegarty’s armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. Our windingsheet. Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. —Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare’s Hamlet though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry. O. U’s, wedding rings, watchchains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected. Out. Out. Out. Outdoor: garden and fieldwork, cycling on level macadamised causeways, ascents of moderately high hills, natation in secluded fresh water and unmolested river boating in secure wherry or light curricle with kedge anchor on reaches free from weirs and rapids period of estivation, vespertinal perambulation or equestrian circumprocession with inspection of sterile landscape and contrastingly agreeable cottagers’ fires of smoking peat turves period of hibernation. Out for the waxies’ Dargle. Out half the night. Out he goes again. Out here in the dark with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther. Out it rushes: blue. Out of a flying machine. Out of an advertisement. Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together. Out of her oakframe a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown artcolours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews stands over Bloom. Out of it out of it. Out of shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Out of sight, out of mind. Out of that, bloody curse to you! Out of that, you mongrel! Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory. —Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly. Out on spec probably. Out on’t! Out on the rampage all night. Out quickly, quickly! Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their brokensnouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. Outside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties. Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in. Outside the Dublin Distillers Company’s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel. Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear. Outtohelloutofthat. Out with the oof. Over after over. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Over against the Rt. Over and done with. Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. Overcome with emotion. Overdose of laudanum. Overdrawn. Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular. Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords:
—When love absorbs my ardent soul... Over the possing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah’s voice, harsh as a corncrake’s, jars on high. Over the stones. Over the stones. Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Overtones. —O, very well, Mr Bloom said. Ow. Ow. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! O wait. O, weeping God, the things I married into! O! Weeshwashtkissinapooisthnapoohuck? —O, welcome back, miss Douce. O well, does no harm. —O, well, he said. O well, poor fellow, it’s not his fault. O, well, she has to live like the rest. O, well: she knows how to mind herself. O, will he? Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the matinée. Owns half Austria. O wonder! O, won’t we have a merry time
     On coronation day! O word of fear! O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things. O yes! O, yes. —O, yes. O, yes! O, yes: a very great success. —O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. O yes, every time. O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue. —O yes, J. J. O’Molloy said eagerly. O, yes, mention there is. O yes, mon loup. —O, yes, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we’ll have all topnobbers. O yes, W. Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the world, including Alexandria? O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite! O, you ruck! Oyster eyes. Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion. PADDY DIGNAM: Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam’s spirit. PADDY DIGNAM: By metempsychosis. —Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf. PADDY DIGNAM: Earnestly. PADDY DIGNAM: In a hollow voice. Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tail stiffpointed, his ears cocked. PADDY DIGNAM: Pray for the repose of his soul. Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him. PADDY DIGNAM: With pricked up ears, winces. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Paddy Leonard asked. Paddy Leonard asked. Paddy Leonard cried. Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates. Paddy Leonard said with scorn. PADDY LEONARD: Stage Irishman! PADDY LEONARD: Thank you. PADDY LEONARD: What am I to do about my rates and taxes? —Paddy? says Alf. Paff! Page of an old copybook. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. Paid off this afternoon. Pain is far. Paint face behind on him then he’d be two. Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Pain to the animal too. Pa is dead. Palefaces. Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. Palestrina for example too. Pallas Athena! Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Palm oil. Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very rara avis altogether. Pal to pal. Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. Pandemonium. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices. Pandybat. Pan’s hour, the faunal noon. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. Pap! Papa’s little bedpal. Paper. Paradise and the peri. Paradise of pretenders then and now. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Parallax. Parallax! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. Paralyse Europe. Parcels post. Pardies and rendered into Engliſh by John Harris D. D. London, printed for R. Knaplock at the Biſhop’s Head, MDCCXI, with dedicatory epiſtle to his worthy friend Charles Cox, eſquire, Member of Parliament for the burgh of Southwark and having ink calligraphed statement on the flyleaf certifying that the book was the property of Michael Gallagher, dated this 10th day of May 1822 and requeſting the perſon who should find it, if the book should be loſt or go aſtray, to reſtore it to Michael Gallagher, carpenter, Dufery Gate, Enniſcorthy, county Wicklow, the fineſt place in the world. Pardon! Pardon? Pardoned a classical allusion. —Pardon, monsieur, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace. Paris and back. —Paris, past and present, he said. Paris rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Paris: the wellpleased pleaser. Par it’s Greek: parallel, parallax. Parked in North Prince’s street His Majesty’s vermilion mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E. R., received loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery. Parleyvoo! Parlour games dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon: embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable. Parlour magic. —Parnell will never come again, he said. Parried again. Parrots. Parson Steve, apostates’ creed! Part. Part for the whole. Particular about his drink. Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea. Partly, I have mislaid... Part shares and part profits. Part shares and part profits. Pass a common remark. Pass by her. Passée. Passed. —Pass, friends, says he. Passing by Roger Greene’s office and Dollard’s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby’s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn’t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring’s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant. Passing now. Passing out he whispered to J. J. O’Molloy:
—Incipient jigs. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. Pass round the consolation. Password. Password. Pastille that was fell. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King’s windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. Past was is today. Pat! Pat! PAT: Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy. Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker’s daughter. Pater! Pater, ait. Paternity may be a legal fiction. Pat is a waiter hard of his hearing. Pat is a waiter who waits while you wait. Pat paid for diner’s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss Douce.

Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. Perhaps I will without writing. Perhaps not to hurt he meant. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. Perhaps so as not to hurt. Perhaps there is someone. Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light. Perhaps they get a man smell off us. Perhaps to Levenston’s dancing academy piano.

     Before my thoughts begin to run
     On F. M’Curdy Atkinson,
     The same that had the wooden leg
     And that filibustering filibeg
     That never dared to slake his drouth,
     Magee that had the chinless mouth. Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:

Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. Pure olive oil. Purse. Puss puss puss puss! Put a pin in that chap, will you? Put beurla on it, littlejohn. Put but money in thy purse. Put down three and carry five. —Put it there, citizen, says Joe. Put me on to Edenville. Put on poor old greatgrandfather. Puts gusto into it. —Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Put them all on to take them all off. —Put these in first, will you? he said.

Quarter mourning. Quarter past. Quarter to. Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering. Queen Anne is dead. Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the Tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the Tantumer gosa cramen tum. Queen’s Ho... Queens lay with prize bulls. Queens of Dublin society. Queenstown harbour full of Italian ships. —Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and. Queer because we both, I mean. Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Queer kind of chap.

Queer the whole atmosphere of the. Queer up there in the cockloft, alone, with stops and locks and keys. Query. Quest for the philosopher’s stone. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. Question of mood you’re in. Que voulez-vous? Quick. Quick. Quick. Quick! Quick! Quick! Quicker. Quicker, darlint! Quick, far and daring. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Quickly he does it. Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues. Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down. Quick of him all the same. Quick round. Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath. Quiet brute. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second. Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields. Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago. —Qui fecit cœlum et terram. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted. —Qui sdegno, Ben, said Father Cowley. Quite a boy. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish immediately acceded to that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem. Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O’Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way. Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Quite bad. Quite charming! Quite dark, regular brunette, black. Quite natural. Quite right. Quite right. Quite right. —Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. Quite right to close it. —Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Quite safe. —Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. —Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed. —Quite well, thanks... Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. —Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?

Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer. Really? Really he was. Really, Mr Bloom said though first he fancied he alluded to the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there could be no possible connection overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bit flabbergasted at Myles Crawford’s after all managing to. Really terrible. Reaping the whirlwind. Reason. Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed. Rebound of garter. Recant! Recent outrage. Recipe for white wine vinegar. Recite the first major part of this chanted legend. Recite the second part minor of the legend. Reclaim the whole place. Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle. Recommend it to your lady and gentlemen friends, lasts a lifetime. —Recorder, says Ned. Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. Red carpet spread. Redcoats. Red face: grey now. Red influences lupus. Red Murray’s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes. Red Murray whispered. Red rails fly spacewards. Red rays are longest. Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity. Reduplication of personality. Reedy freckled soprano. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation. Reflections on his vigour a bounder, corporal proportion a billsticker, commercial ability a bester, impressionability a boaster. Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply. Reformed prostitute will address the meeting. Refracts is it? heat. Refuge of sinners. Refuse christian burial. Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle. Regular hotbed of it lately. Regularly engaged. Regular square feed for them. Regular world in itself. Rehearsing his band part. Reincarnation: that’s the word. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with large wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp:
 THE CARDINAL:
     Conservio lies captured
     He lies in the lowest dungeon
     With manacles and chains around his limbs
     Weighing upwards of three tons. Relics of old decency. Relieving office here. Religion pays. Religions. Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent Milly, he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion Molly. —Rely on me, says Joe. —Remanded, says J. J.
 One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. Remedy where you least expect it. Remember. Remember. Remember? Remember about the mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom’s. Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up. Remember him in your prayers. Remember if you do not I will punish you. Remembering thee, O Sion. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. Remember me to Molly, won’t you? Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgrossfather made the first confessionbox. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships’ lanterns. Remember that till their dying day. Remember that time? Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked. Remember write Greek ees. Remerciez! Remind him of home sweet home. Reminds me of strawberries and cream. Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face. Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the Evening Telegraph, late pink edition, in the cabman’s shelter, at Butt bridge. Remove him. Remove him, acushla. Renewed laughter. —Repeat that dose, says Joe. Repent! Repentance skindeep. Repent, Stephen. Reporters complain that they cannot hear. Repugnant wretch! Requiem mass. —Requiescat! Rescue of fallen women. Reserve better. Reserved about to yield. Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:
—And going forth he met Butterly. Respect. Respectable girl meet after mass. Respectable woman. Respect his liberty. Respect yourself. Resp. girl R.C. wishes to hear of post in fruit or pork shop. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall. Restless. Rest rubble, sprawling suburbs, jerrybuilt. Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air. Result of the Gold Cup races! and from the door of Dignam’s house a boy ran out and called. Result of the rockinghorse races. Retaining the perpendicular. Retain your own. Retamplatan digidi boumboum. Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning. Return and see. Returned Indian officer. Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents. Returning not the same. RETURN OF BLOOM
—Yes, he said. Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. Reuben J. A florin I find him. Reuben J Antichrist, wandering jew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Reuben J Dodd, blackbearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory. Reuben J’s son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge. REUBEN J: Whispers hoarsely. Reuben of that ilk. Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers a pretty sight it is to see, in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked. £ 5 reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street, missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold Poldy, height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Rhapsodies about damn all. Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. RHYMES AND REASONS
 Mouth, south. Rhymes: two men dressed the same, looking the same, two by two. Rhythm begins, you see. Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann what’s in a name?, woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. Rich booty you brought back; Le Tutu, five tattered numbers of Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge; a blue French telegram, curiosity to show:
—Mother dying come home father. Richie, admiring, descanted on that man’s glorious voice. RICHIE: Best value in Dub. Richie cocked his lips apout. RICHIE: Goodgod. Richie Goulding and the legal bag. RICHIE GOULDING: Bagweighted, passes the door. Richie Goulding: he’s another. Richie Goulding listened. Richie Goulding, three ladies’ hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. Richie led on. Richie rift in the lute alone sat: Goulding, Collis, Ward. Richie turned. RICHIE: With a cry of pain, his hand to his back. Rich sound. Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro. Ride a cockhorse. Riding astride. Rien va plus! Rift in the lute I think. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel. Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called. Right here it began. —Right, M’Coy said brightly. —Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. —Right now? Righto, any old time. Righto, Isaacs, shove em out of the bleeding limelight. —Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine! Right, Pat. —Right, says John Wyse. —Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. Right, sir. Right, sir. —Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off. Rinderpest. —Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold. Ringsend. Ringsend: wigwams of brown steersmen and master mariners. Ripening now. Rip: tear in Henny Doyle’s overcoat. Rip van Winkle! Rip van Winkle we played. Risk it. Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrrrrrmmmmm. —Roast and mashed here. —Roast beef and cabbage. Roastbeef for old England. Roast him! —Robbed, says he. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Robert Emmet’s last words. Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn’t he? Roberto ruba roba sua. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Rocket and breeches buoy and lifeboat. Rock, the head bailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard. Rollicking Richie once. Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes. Rome boose for the Bloom toff. Romeo. Room whirls back. Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Rorke’s Drift! Rose of Castile. Roses, I think. Rot quick in damp earth. Rough weather outside. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. Round and round slow. Round him peered Lenehan. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Roundness you think good. Round Rabaiotti’s halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Round the Kish in eighty days. Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her. Round to Menton’s office. Round towers. Roun wi the nappy. Rover cycleshop. Rows of cast. Rows of cast steel. Rows of grimy houses with gaping doors. Row with her in the XL Café about the bracelet.

Roygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Rrpr. Rrr. Rrrpr. Rrrrrr. Rrrrrrrsss. Rtststr! Rubber goods. Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month. Rub off the microbes with your handkerchief. Ruby: the Pride of the Ring. Rudolph Bloom deceased narrated to his son Leopold Bloom aged 6 a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary, with commercial advice having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves. RUDOLPH: Once! RUDOLPH: Second halfcrown waste money today. RUDOLPH: Severely. RUDOLPH: What you making down this place? RUDOLPH: With contempt. Rudy. Rudy. Rudy! RUDY: Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom’s eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. Rugger. Ruins and tenements. Ruin them. Rule the world today. —Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said. RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER: Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with gladstone bag which he opens. RUMBOLD: I’m near it myself. RUMBOLD: To the recorder with sinister familiarity. Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse. Ruminants. Rummaging. Rumour had it though not proved that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a thing I simply hate to see. Run. Runaway horse. Running after me. Running into cakeshops. —Run on, Stephen said. Run over by tram. Run, skelter, race. Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind. Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all. Run you through the small guts for nothing. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Russell. Russell. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks’ board. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Rut. Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave. Ruttledge’s door: ee creaking. Révérence! —Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly. —Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all at all? —Sacrifizio incruento, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly. Sacrilege! Sad about her lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity. Sad booser’s eyes. Sad case. SAD
 Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. Sad end of government printer’s clerk. Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa’s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller’s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah. Sadly missed. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze. Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear. —Sad, Martin Cunningham said. Sad music. —Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely. Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O’Rourke. —Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen’s womaneyes said melancholily. Sad too. Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful. Safe! Safe arrival of Antichrist. Safe home! Safe home to Dolly. Safe in a minute. Safe in one way. Safe in the arms of kingdom come. Safer to eat from his three hands. Saffron bun and milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy. Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Said that. —Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone? Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit. Saint Frusquin was her sire. Saint Joseph’s church, Portland row. Saint Leopold’s. Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity. —Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores. —Saint Thomas, Stephen began... —Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent. Saloon motor hearses. Salt green death. Salt in the Ormond damp. Salt junk all the time. Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips. Salty too. Salut! Salute. Salute! Salute! Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back. Salvation army blatant imitation. Salvi facti sunt. —Same again, Terry, says Joe. Same as Citron’s house. Same bait. Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Same here. Same house as Molly’s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. Same notice on the door. Same old dingdong always. Same old six and eightpence. —Same only more so, says Lenehan. Same style of beauty. Same style of beauty. Same thing watered down. Same thing with ads. Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear. Same time might prefer a tie undone or something. Sand in the Red Sea done that. Sands and stones. Sandwich? Sandycove! Sandy shrivelled smell he seems to have. Sanktus! Sardines on the shelves. —Sargent! Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses. Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook. Satan, you’ll sing no more lovesongs. Satirically. Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise, of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality. Saucebox. Sauce for the gander. Sauce for the goose, my gander O.
 BLOOM: They... Saucy knave! Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair. Save. Save. Save China’s millions. Save her. Save him from hell, O Divine Sacred Heart! Save it they can’t. Saves them. —Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.
—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan. —Save you kindly, says J. J. What’ll it be, Ned? Saving princes is a thank you job. Saw a pool near her foot. Saw her in the viceregal party when Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the Express. Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Saw him out at the Three Jolly Topers marching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a marketnet. Saw something in me. Say! Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out. Sayest thou so? Say half a crown. Say he got ten per cent off. Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw? Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Say it again. Say it cuts lo. Say it’s turn six. Say it was black, for instance. —Say nothing! Say out big, big. —Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life. Says he found a sweet young thing down there. Says he’s your father, sir. Say something. Say something to him. Says that over everybody. Say ten barrels of stuff. Say, thank you, mistress. —Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:
—Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Say they won’t eat pork. Say you never see them with three colours. —Scald the teapot. Scalp wants oiling. Scamp! Scandalous! Scandalous! Scaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway heard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all treading, boots not the boots the boy. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Scarlet runners. Scavenging what the quality left. Scene at Westland row. Scep. contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods. Scep. remark or should it be called an interruption? that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to. Sceptre a shade heavier. —Sceptre will win in a canter, he said. Sceptre wins! Sceptre with O. Madden up. Schedule time. Schluss. Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim. Science. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. Scissors and paste. Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Scoot. Scott of Dawson street. Scoundrel, said he, You’ll sing no more lovesongs. Scowl or smile. Scrape. Scrape: nearly gone. Scratch my head. Scratch the sole of my foot. Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open. Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Scrum in.

SECOND WATCH: All right, Mr Kelleher. SECOND WATCH: An alibi. SECOND WATCH: Another! SECOND WATCH: Awed, whispers. SECOND WATCH: Blesses himself. SECOND WATCH: Genially. SECOND WATCH: I don’t want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. SECOND WATCH: It’s our duty. SECOND WATCH: Night, Mr Kelleher. SECOND WATCH: Points to the corner. SECOND WATCH: Prevention of cruelty to animals. SECOND WATCH: Produces handcuffs. SECOND WATCH: Tears in his eyes, to Bloom. SECOND WATCH: That’s all right, sir. SECOND WATCH: Who are you? Secret eyes, secretsearching. Secret of all secrets. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned. Secured the verdict cleverly by a length. See. See. See? —See? See. See. See! See. See? See blank tee what domestic animal? Seed near free poun on un a spell ago a said war hisn. Seedy cuss in the Richmond? See her as she is spoil all. —See here, he said, showing Antonio. See her from here though. See her in her dishybilly. —See? he said. —See? he said. See him grow up. See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the trick. See his phiz then. —See if you can do anything with that, he said. Seeing her home after practice. Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the élite society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente. Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather. See! it displodes for thee in abundance. See it in your eye. See it in your eye. See it in your face. Seekers on the great quest. Seek thou the light. See me he might. —Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon. Seems anything but pleased. Seems a sort of a joke. Seems new. Seems not. Seems to a secret touch telling me memory. —Seems to be, J. J. O’Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Seems to be what you call yashmak or I mean kismet. Seems to see with his fingers. Seem to like it. Seen him today at a runefal? Seen its best days. See, not be seen. See now.

See, thy fleece is drenched. See what I meant, see? See ye here. See, you have forgotten. See you later. See your whole life in a flash. Selfish those t.t’s are. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. Selling new at two guineas. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M’Swiney’s. Sell on easy terms to capture trade. Sell the monkey! Sell the monkey, boys! Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned round a squaw. S’elp me, honest injun. Semigrand open crocodile music hath jaws. Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown. Send him back the half of a cow. —Send it at once, will you? he said.

Send us bright one, light one, Horhorn, quickening and wombfruit. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service. Sense of smell must be stronger too. Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment. Sensitive. Sensitive plants. Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian fieldmarshal now. —Separatio a mensa et a thalamo, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on. Separation. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S. J. on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African Mission. Serpents too are gluttons for woman’s milk. Serum and virus. Serve! Set down his glass. Set of dancing masters! Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Settle my hat straight. Settling those napkins. Seven Davy Byrne’s. —Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. —Seven d., sir... Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. Seven is dear to the mystic mind. Seven last words. Seventh heaven. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God’s angel to Mary quoth. Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheep’s tails, odd pieces of fat. Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Sex breaking out even then. —Seymour a bleeding officer! Seymour Bushe got him off. —Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock. Shabby genteel. Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about. Shadow of my mind. ... shadows... the woods
     ... white breast... dim sea. Shah of Persia liked that best. Shake a shake. Shake hands. Shake hands, brother. Shakes. Shakespeare Bacon’s wild oats. —Shakespeare has left the huguenot’s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank. SHAKESPEARE: In dignified ventriloquy. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance. Shakespeare said. Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. Shakespeare’s Works dark crimson morocco, goldtooled. SHAKESPEARE: With paralytic rage. Shaking sleep out of it. Shakti Shiva, darkhidden Father! Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. Shall I nevermore behold thee? Shall us? Shall we see you at Moore’s tonight? Shame all put on before third person. Shame of death. Shame really. Shandygaff? Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Shapely bathers on golden strand. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the world admires. Shapely too. Shark liver oil they use to clean. Sharp as needles they are. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. Shatter me you who can. Shatter them, one and both. Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! She... She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part. She always kept things decent in
     The Hannigan famileye. She answered:
—Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs? She answered, slighting:
—Ask no questions and you’ll hear no lies. She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth. She asked. She asked him was that so. She asked you who was in your room. She bent. She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches. She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth, sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. She blushes and makes a knee. She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed. She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights. She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch. She broke off suddenly. Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed flower in his coat: who gave him?, and syrupped with her voice:
—Fine goods in small parcels. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. She buys dear and sells cheap. She calls her children home in their dark language. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt. She claps her hands. She climbed their crooked tree and I... She clutches again in her robe. She clutches the two crowns. She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve. She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retroussé from where he was sitting. She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. She counts. She cries. She crosses the threshold. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft. She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:
—Heart of my heart, were it more,
 More would be laid at your feet. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg. She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath. She darts back to the table. She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms. She’d have won the money only for the other dog. She did. She did get flushed in the wind. She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! She did not mind. She didn’t know what to do
     To keep it up,
     To keep it up. She didn’t like her plate full. She didn’t like it because I sprained my ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf. She didn’t mean it, Mr Bello. She didn’t want anything. She died, for literature at least, before she was born. —She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She dies. She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat. She’d like scent of that kind. She does whack it, by George. She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:
—What time is the funeral? She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins. She draws from behind, ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout. She drew down pensive why did he go so quick when I? about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, eau de Nil. She drew herself up to her full height. She drops two pennies in the slot. Sheer force of natural genius, that. Sheet kindly lent. Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings. She fades from his side. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch. She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error. She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. She frees herself, droops on a chair. She frowns with lowered head. She gave her moist a lady’s hand to his firm clasp. She gazed out towards the distant sea. She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils. She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus. She gives him the glad eye. She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl. She glances back. She glances round her at the couples. She glides away crookedly. She glides sidling and bowing, twirling japanesily. She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock. She goes to the pianola. She goes to window. —She got the things, she said. She had. She had a gorgeous, simply gorgeous, time. She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy. She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec. She had loved him better than he knew. She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own. She had no intention of being at their beck and call. She had no navel. She had no water, it appears, in her hold. She had outlived him. She had plenty of game in her then. She had red slippers on. She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve. She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand. She has a fine pair, God bless her. She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again. She has a sprouting moustache. She has it. She has it, she got it,
     Wherever she put it,
     The leg of the duck. She has large pendant beryl eardrops. She has something to put in them. She has the Spanish type. She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh, and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking. She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:
     I am the boy
     That can enjoy
     Invisibility. She held it to her own. She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna. She holds a Scottish widow’s insurance policy and a large marquee umbrella under which her brood run with her, Patsy hopping on one shod foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cod’s mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple. She hurries out. She is a bad merchant. She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps, quinsy, bunions, hayfever, bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney, Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold feet, varicose veins. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. She is drowning. She is more taking then. She is not the filly that she was. She is our great sweet mother. She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame in rue Gît-le-Cœur, canary and two buck lodgers. She is right, our sister. She is right, our sister. She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. She keens with banshee woe. She kicked the bucket. She kissed me. She kissed me. She knew at once. She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn’t live. She knew he meant the monkey was sick. She knew I, I think she knew by the way she. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers’ quarrel. She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean. She laughed:
—O wept! She lays eggs for us. She lay still. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her. She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. She leaned on the sideboard watching. —She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes. She liked mignonette. She limps over to the table. She listens. She listens with big dark soft eyes. She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters. She’ll be good, sir. Shells. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. She longed to go. She looked. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her. She looked back at him, mewing. She looked fine. She loosened many a man’s thighs. She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. Shelter, for the night. Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu. Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad. She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly. She might like something tasty. She mightn’t like me to come that way without letting her know. She murmurs. She must. She must have been thinking of someone else all the time. —She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. She nobly answered: with a gentleman friend. She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips. She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant. She often said she’d like to visit. She ought to. She passed a remark. She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you, my child, that they have been absolved, pray for me. She pats him. She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws. She paws his sleeve, slobbering. She peers at his hands abruptly. Shepherd his pipe. She plops splashing out of the water. She points. She points to his forehead. She poured again a measureful and a tilly. She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. She prays. She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She puffs calmly at her cigarette. She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:
—What’s your name? She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. She put on nine pounds after weaning. She puts out her hand inquisitively. She puts the potato greedily into a pocket then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix. She put the first nail in his coffin. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly. She raises her blackened withered right arm slowly towards Stephen’s breast with outstretched finger. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the Merry Wives and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she thought over Hooks and Eyes for Believers’ Breeches and The most Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze. She reclines her head, sighing. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips. She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware. She rolled downhill at Rialto bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She rose. She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub. She rubs sides with him. She runs to Stephen. She runs to the pianola. She rushes out. She’s a. She’s a bit imbecillic. She’s a gamey mare and no mistake. She said it would look nice over the bed. She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men’s oil to his limbs. She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman’s birth. She saw him into and out of the world. —She’s better where she is, he said kindly. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She scribbled three figures on an envelope. She’s drunk. She seems sad. She seizes Bloom’s coattail. She seizes Florry and waltzes her. —She’s engaged for a big tour end of this month. She serves me at his beck. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman’s warmhosed thigh. She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow. She settles them down quickly. She’s game. She’s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth. She, she, she. She’s his wife. She shouted in his ear the tidings. She shouts. She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off. She sighs. She signs with a waggling forefinger. She sings. She’s in the lying-in hospital in Holles street. She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea. She sits. She sits. She’s lame! She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back. —She’s making for Bullock harbour. She smelt an onion. She smiled on him. She smilesmirked supercilious wept! aren’t men?, but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan. She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years now, sailing about. She snakes her neck, nestling. She sneers. She’s not exactly witty. She’s not here. She’s not here. She’s not nicelooking, is she? She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orangeflower. She’s on the job herself tonight with the vet her tipster that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. She’s passed. She’s passing now. She’s right after all. She’s singing, yes. She’s taking it all in. She stands. She’s three days bad now. She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change. She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. She’s waiting for me, I know. She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word. She’s well nourished, I tell you. She swishes her huntingcrop savagely in the air. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She’s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound. She takes his hand. She taunts him. She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out. She thanked me. She thinks. She thinks. She thought she understood. She thought you wanted a cheese hollandais. She too. She took a folded postcard from her handbag. She took a penknife out of her pocket
     And cut off his little head. She took back the card, sighing. She took his first embraces. She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:
—Ah fox met ah stork. She tosses a piece. She traces lines on his hand. She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load. She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. She turned over sleepily that time. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. She turns up Bloom’s hand. She twentythree. She understands all she wants to. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external. She used to be a tasty dresser. She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice. She wails. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell was... She was... She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. —She was a daughter of... She was a finelooking woman. She was a nice old bag of tricks. She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past. She was crying in her wretched bed. She was entitled to her widow’s dower At common law. She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. She was humming. She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She was leading the field. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She wasn’t in a hurry either. She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. She was reading the card, propped on her elbow. —She was taken bad on the Tuesday... She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a Friday. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband. She waved about her outspread Independent, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to wind, love, speeding sail, return. She whips it off. She whirls it back in right circle. She whirls the prize in left circle. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. She won in a thunderstorm, Rothschild’s filly, with wadding in her ears. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess. She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide. She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did. She would have given worlds to know what it was. She would make the great sacrifice. She would marry another. She would try to understand him because men were so different. She writes. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind. Shilling a bottle of stout. SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT
—Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. Shining word! Shiny peels: polishes them up with a rag or a handkerchief. Shipahoy of course had his own say to say. Shirt is synechdoche. —Shirts, Maggy said. Shitbroleeth. Shite! Shite and onions! Shiver my timbers if I had. Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices. Shoe trick. Shoot! Shoot him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered walls all brass buttons. Shop closes early on Thursday. SHORT BUT TO THE POINT
—Whose land? Short but yet Plain Elements of Geometry written in French by F. Ignat. Short cut home here. Short little finger. Short snooze now if I had. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Should a girl tell? Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset. Shoulders. Shoulder to the wheel. Should have put on coldcream first make it brown. —Shout! Shout a few flying syllables as they pass. Shouting in his ear. Shout salvation in King Jesus. Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle. Shove ahead. Shove him a joey and grahamise. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. —Show. Show! Show! —Show here, she said. Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts. Showing their teeth at one another. Show me in. Show no surprise. Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart. Shows you the money to be made out of porter. Show this gentleman the door. Show us a minute. —Show us, Joe, says I. Show us one of them cushions. —Show us over the drink, says I. Show us over those apricots, meaning peaches. Show us the entrance out. Shreds. Shrieks of dying. Shrieks of silence. Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy’s throat. Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. Shrunken skull. Shrunken uncertain hand. Shut his blurry Dutch oven with a firm hand. Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden. Shut the book quick. Shut up. Shut your eyes and open your mouth. Shut your eyes and see. Shut your eyes, gents. Shut your obstropolos. Shy but willing like an ass pissing. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen’s leech Lopez, his jew’s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: Hamlet and Macbeth with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting. Shy, supping with the godless, he sneaks the cup. Si. Side by side Bloom, profiting by the contretemps, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad. —Si Dedalus’ voice, he said. Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have! Signed: Dedalus. Sign H. They like sad tail at end. Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence. Sign on long o’ me. Signor Maffei, passionpale, in liontamer’s costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paperhoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the gorging boarhound. SIGNOR MAFFEI: With a sinister smile. Signs of rain it is. Signs on a white field. Silence! Silence, all. Silence all round marked the termination of his finale. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement. Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces. Silentium! Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes. Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside. Silk flash rich stockings white. Silk, mistress said! Silk of the kine! Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times. Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Silly fish learn nothing in a thousand years. Silly, isn’t it? Silly lips of that chap. Silly man! Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave. Silly Milly’s birthday gift. Silly season. Silly superstition that about thirteen. Silver means born rich. Silverpowdered olivetrees. Silver threads among the grey. Similarly?

Simon Dedalus said when they put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the grave and lead him out of the house of commons by the arm. Simon Dedalus’ son.

Since Easter he had cursed three times. Since I fed the birds five minutes. Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala. Since when, for God’ sake? Sing, birdy, sing. Singing. Singing. Singing with his eyes shut. Singing wrong words. Sing out! Sings too: Down among the dead men. Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest.

Sleep six months out of twelve. SLEEPY HOLLOW: Rip van Wink! Slide. Slide left foot one pace back! Slieve Bloom. ’Slife, I’ll be round with you. Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. Slight spasm, full, chewing the cud. Slily. Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork. Slips off when the fun gets too hot. Sllt. Sllt. Sllt. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he’d wake. Sloping into the Empire. Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired. Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. Slow music, please. Slumming. Slung her hook, she did. Smack. Smack. Smaller from want of use. Small nines. Small wages. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Smart. Smart Boylan bespoke potions. Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once. —Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred. Smash a man to atoms if they got him caught. Smell almost cure you like the dentist’s doorbell. Smelling the tail end of ports. Smell of burn. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving. Smells of men. Smells on all sides, bunched together. Smell that. Smell that I did. Smile. Smile. Smile Cranly’s smile. Smiled: creamfruit smell. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window. Smith O’Brien. Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Smutty Moll for a mattress jig. Snakes of river fog creep slowly. —Snapshot, eh? Snapshot photography, comparative study of religions, folklore relative to various amatory and superstitious practices, contemplation of the celestial constellations. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. Snivel. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs. Snuffy Dr Murren. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper. So. So. So. So! So. So. So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over. So and So, wheelwright. So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast. So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid. So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Soap feeling rather sticky behind. So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:
—Foreign wars is the cause of it. So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. Sober hearsedrivers a speciality. Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I’d say. So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there. So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her. Sociable. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews. So Cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out. Sodachapped hands. So distinct. So excited. So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!... Soft day, your honour! Soft eyes. Softly. Softly he sang to a dusty seascape there: A Last Farewell. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed. Soft mark. Softsoaping. Soft soft soft hand. Soft warm sticky gumjelly lips. Soft word. Soggarth Aroon? So he calls the old dog over. So here’s to disciples and Calvary. So he’s gone. So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun. So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket. So he was. So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. So he was, faith. So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. —So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob hundred shillings to five while I was letting off my Throwaway twenty to letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery’s off in his mind to get off the mark to hundred shillings is five quid and when they were in the dark horse pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick gob, must have done about a gallon flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she’s better or she’s ow! all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or Jesus, full up I was trading without a licence ow! So I landed them up on Behan’s car and down to nighttown. Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. Soil must be simply swirling with them. So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be. So in the moon’s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore’s tempting flood. So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust. So it is. —So it is, Mr Dedalus said. So it returns. —So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed. So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I’m not. So J. J. ordered the drinks. So J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation. So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. So Joe took up the letters. Soldier and civilian. Solemn. Solemn as Troy. Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. Solicitor, I think. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor’s Walk. Solitary. Solitary. Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Soll und Haben by Gustav Freytag black boards, Gothic characters, cigarette coupon bookmark at p. Solomon did. So lonely. —So long! So long as they do no worse. So long as women don’t mock what matter? So may the Creator deal with me. Some animal. Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. Some chap in the blues. SOME COLUMN!—THAT’S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID
—That’s new, Myles Crawford said. —Some, Dilly said. Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Some girl. Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Some H2O for a gent fainted. Some Kildare street club toff had it probably. Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Some light still. Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night’s oncoming. Some of that old sacred music splendid. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. —Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily. Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them. —Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said. —Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said. Someone taking a rise out of him. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Someone walking over it. Someone was to read them there after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara. —Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before. —Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others’ eyes but they can’t see the beam in their own. Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. Some pock or oth. Some reason. Some say they remember their past lives. Some school treat. Something about withering plants I read in a garden. Something confused. Something detective read off blottingpad. Something evidently riled them in his death. —Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Something galoptious. Something going on: some sodality. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Something he buried there, his grandmother. Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers. Something inside them goes pop. Something in the air. Something like those mazzoth: it’s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread. Something new and easy. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting. Something occult: symbolism. Something pinned on: photo perhaps. Something poisonous I ate. Something quite ordinary. Something the nurse taught me. Something to catch the eye. Something to eat? Something to hand on. Something with a bite in it. Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Sometimes they go off. —Some time yesterday, Stephen said. Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Some trouble is on here. Someway in his. Somewhere. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall. Somewhere in Cabra, what? Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn. Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period. Somnambulist. Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation. So Mr Justice Madden in his Diary of Master William Silence has found the hunting terms... So much dead weight. So much for M’Intosh! So much the better. Songs without words. Sonnez. Sonnez! —Sonnez! Sonnez la. Sonnez la. Sonnez la. Sonnez la cloche! Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris. So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:
—Give us the paw! So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:
—Or also living in different places. So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. So on. So on. Soon be a woman. Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. Soon got, soon gone. Soon I am old. —Soot’s luck, says Joe. So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church. SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS. SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS. ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.
—You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist. Sorra one o’ me knows. —Sorrow from me seemed to depart. Sorry I didn’t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn’t. Sorry, Jack. —Sorry, Mr Bloom said. Sorry, sir: trouble. —So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled. So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice. So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £. s. d. in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old Ireland tavern, come back to Erin and so on. So, Spain. So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other. So Terry brought the three pints. So that gesture, not music not odour, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm. So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:
—A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it Palme on Booterstown strand. So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game. So the wife comes out top dog, what? So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar. So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on. So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place. So Thursday sixteenth June Patk. So to change the subject he read about Dignam R. I. Soulfully. Sound as a bell. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well. —Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names. Sounds better than last time I heard. Sounds solid: made by the mallet of Los Demiurgos. Soup, joint and sweet. Source of life. Sour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a moonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying. Souse in the ear sometimes. South Frederick street. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. South side anyhow. 1000 sovs with 3000 in specie. So warm. So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. So we turned into Barney Kiernan’s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink. So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. So womanly, full. So you catch no money. So you think... Space: what you damn well have to see. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America. —Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen. Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. Spanishy eyes. Spare my past. Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure’s skyblue bow and eyes. Spat-on sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarettesmoke, reek of plug, spilt beer, men’s beery piss, the stale of ferment. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him. Speaking. Speaking about me. Speaking to me. Speak on. —Speak up for yourself, Mr O’Madden Burke said. Speak when you’re spoken to. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver! Speak, you! Speak you englishman tongue for double entente cordiale. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Special recipe. Speech paused on Richie’s lips. Speech, speech. —Speriamo, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. Sphinx. Spice of pleasure. Spit in your own eye, boss! Spittoon! Splendid! Splendid! Spoils slung at her back. Spoke to me. Spontaneous combustion. Spontaneously to seek out the saurian’s lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Spooks. —Spooning with him last night on the pier. SPOT THE WINNER
 Lenehan came out of the inner office with Sport’s tissues. Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. Spread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls’ kitchen area. Springers. Spud again the rheumatiz? Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. Spurned and undespairing. Spurned lover. Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they work the whole show. Square it you with the boss and we’ll split the job, see? Squarepushing up against a backdoor. Squealing cat. Squeezing or. Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Sraid Mabbot. Ssh! Sss. Sst! Sst! Stables behind Moira house. Stable with those halfcastes. Staggering bob. Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf, thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage. STAGGERING BOB: Large teardrops rolling from his prominent eyes, snivels. Stag that one is! Stains on his coat. Stale. Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs. Stamps: stickyback pictures. Stand and deliver. —Stand and deliver, says he. Stand by. Standing? Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles. Stands a drink now and then. Stand up at the gospel of course. —Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. —Stand up straight, girl, he said. Stand up to it then with force like men. Stand us a drink itself. Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart. Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering. Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Start afresh. Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. —Start, Palmerston Park! Stationer’s just here too. Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde’s love that dare not speak its name. Stave it off awhile. Stay, good friend. Stay in. Stays. Steadfast John replied severe:

Steal upon larks. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door, his wild harp slung behind him. Stephano Dedalo, alumno optimo, palmam ferenti. Stephanos, my crown. Stephen! Stephen! Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flies from the room, past the whores at the door. STEPHEN: Abruptly. STEPHEN: Addressed her in vocative feminine. STEPHEN: Aha! STEPHEN: Ah non, par exemple! STEPHEN: Altius aliquantulum. STEPHEN: Amiably. Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve. Stephen answered himself. Stephen anyhow lent him one of them. STEPHEN: Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? Stephen, arming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her round the room. STEPHEN: As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. Stephen asked. Stephen asked. Stephen asked. Stephen asked. Stephen asked. Stephen asked. Stephen asked, beginning to smile. Stephen asked her. Stephen asked, opening another book. STEPHEN: A time, times and half a time. STEPHEN: At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence. Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack. STEPHEN: Break my spirit, will he? STEPHEN: Brings the match near his eye. STEPHEN: Cardinal sin. STEPHEN: Catches sight of Lynch’s and Kitty’s heads. STEPHEN: Choking with fright, remorse and horror. Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face. Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells. STEPHEN: Comes to the table. STEPHEN: Cracking his fingers impatiently. STEPHEN: Dance of death. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak. Stephen Dedalus, professor and author. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck. 
 Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary’s fingers prove a timedulled chain. STEPHEN: Delightedly. Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:
—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s death? STEPHEN: Devoutly. STEPHEN: Did I? Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. STEPHEN: Doesn’t matter a rambling damn. STEPHEN: Eagerly. STEPHEN: Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey. Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding born Grier. STEPHEN: Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Stephen exclaimed. STEPHEN: Extends his arms. STEPHEN: Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods. Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker. Stephen filled again the three cups. Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk. Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Stephen followed a lubber... Stephen freed his arm quietly. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her. STEPHEN: Gabbles with marionette jerks. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front. Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought. STEPHEN: Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself. STEPHEN: Groans. Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:
—In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait. Stephen handed him the key. Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature. STEPHEN: Hands Bella a coin. STEPHEN: Hands him all his coins. STEPHEN: Hark! STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. STEPHEN: Here’s another for you. Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. Stephen, his throat itching, answered:
—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush. STEPHEN: Ho! STEPHEN: Horrorstruck. STEPHEN: How do I stand you? STEPHEN: How is that? STEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago, Richard Crookback, Edmund in King Lear, two bear the wicked uncles’ names. Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B. did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and Byrd William who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull. STEPHEN: In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. STEPHEN: I seem to annoy them. Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:
—That is God. STEPHEN: Kings and unicorns! Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand. Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. STEPHEN: Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world. Stephen laughed. STEPHEN: Laughs emptily. STEPHEN: Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat iuventutem meam. Stephen listened in scornful silence. Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his ashplanthandle over his knee. Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots. Stephen looks at it. STEPHEN: Looks behind. STEPHEN: Looks up to the sky. STEPHEN: Lucifer. STEPHEN: Mark me. STEPHEN: Mincingly. STEPHEN: Murmurs. STEPHEN: Murmurs. STEPHEN: Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up. STEPHEN: No! STEPHEN: Nods, smiling and laughing. STEPHEN: No, I flew. STEPHEN: Nothung! STEPHEN: No voice. Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was In Old Madrid, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment. Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. Stephen once by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. STEPHEN: Out of it now. STEPHEN: Over his shoulder to Zoe. STEPHEN: Panting. STEPHEN: Pas seul! Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:
—We can’t change the country. Stephen picked it up and put it on. STEPHEN: Points. Stephen prayed. Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Stephen put the hat on his head. Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare. Stephen raised the sheets in his hand. Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker. Stephen rose. Stephen rustled the sheets again. Stephen said. Stephen said. Stephen said. Stephen said rudely. Stephen said with tingling energy. Stephen sat down. Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. STEPHEN: See? Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her. Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James. Stephen shakes his head. Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:
—I am not thinking of the offence to my mother. Stephen sketched a brief gesture. Stephen’s mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor, in leper grey with a wreath of faded orangeblossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with gravemould. STEPHEN: Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. STEPHEN: Stick, no. Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words. Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Stephen stood up. Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. STEPHEN: Strangled with rage. STEPHEN: Stringendo He has hidden his own name, a fair name, William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas. Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief. STEPHEN: Swaying. Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it. Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. STEPHEN:
     The fox crew, the cocks flew,
     The bells in heaven
     Were striking eleven. STEPHEN: The ghoul! STEPHEN:
     The harlot’s cry from street to street
     Shall weave Old Ireland’s windingsheet. Stephen, the youthful bard. Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe round the waist. STEPHEN: Throws up his hands. Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned, in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher. STEPHEN: Thursday. STEPHEN: To have or not to have that is the question. STEPHEN: To himself. STEPHEN: To Private Compton. Stephen totters, collapses, falls, stunned. Stephen touched the edges of the book. STEPHEN: Tries to move off. STEPHEN: Triumphaliter. Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind. Stephen turned away. Stephen turned boldly in his chair. Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes. Stephen turned in surprise. STEPHEN: Turns. Stephen turns and sees Bloom. STEPHEN: Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. STEPHEN: We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade. Stephen whirls giddily. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door. Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied:
—To fill the ear of a cow elephant. STEPHEN: Why striking eleven? STEPHEN: With an effort. STEPHEN: With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly. STEPHEN: With exaggerated politeness. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh. Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows. STEPHEN: You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. Step in. Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband. Steve boy, you’re going it some. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Sticking them all over the place. Stick it in a chap’s eye in the tram. Stick one into Jerry. Sticks too like a summer cold, sore on the mouth. Still... Still always nice to hear. Still, an act of perfect contrition. Still an idea behind it. Still as regards return. Still better tell him. Still: but an itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will. Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink hers were, that is if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg. Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath. Still gardens have their drawbacks. Still harping on his daughter. Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick. Still hear it better here than in the bar though farther. Still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave. Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Still he knows his own business best. Still, he’s the best of that lot. Still he was a courteous old chap. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn’t it? Still hold her back. Still, I don’t know. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. Still, I feel. Still if he works that paragraph. Still I got to know that young Dixon who dressed that sting for me in the Mater and now he’s in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy. Still in London. Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all. —Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work, mental or manual. Still it’s the same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out of making money hand over fist finger in fishes’ gills can’t write his name on a cheque think he was painting the landscape with his mouth twisted. Still it was a kind of language between us. Still I will help him in his fight. Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. Still life. Still like you better untidy. Still no matter what the cause is from... Still no-one can give what he hasn’t got. Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Still perhaps: once in a way. —Still running, says he. —Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife. Still seeking, he said:
—When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply. Still, she might do worse. Still, she’s a dear girl. Still she was game. Still some might ooze out of an artery. Still, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general. Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition. Still, the flowers are more poetical. Still their neigh can be very irritating. Still the name: Martha. Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood though other children of the same marriage do not must certainly, in the poet’s words, give us pause. —Still there? Still there’s destiny in it, falling in love. Still they’d kiss all right if properly keyed up. Still they get their feed all right and their doss. Still they might like. Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small. Still, true to life also. Still two types there are you bob against. Still you can hear. Still you have to get rid of it someway. Still you learn something. Still, you never know. Stimulate the caloric. Stink gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens. Stinks like a polecat. Stomachs like breadgraters. —Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly. Stonewall or fivebarred gate put her mount to it. Stop! Stop. Stop. Stop! Stop. —Stop! Stop! Stop. Stop! Stopabloom! Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Stop Bloom! Stopgap. Stophim on the corner! Stop or I’ll tell the missus on you. Stopped. Stopped again. Stopped in Citron’s saint Kevin’s parade. Stopped short never to go again when the old. Stopped with Dick Tivy. Stopperrobber! Stop! says Joe. Stop that and begin worse. Stop them from fighting! Stop thief! Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. Stout lady does be with you in the brown costume. Stowing in the wreaths probably. Straight on her pins anyway not like the other. —Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added. Strange feeling it would be. Strange he never saw his real country. Strange how they take to me. Strange kind of music that last night. Strange moment for the mother too. Strange name. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! Straw hat in sunlight. Stream of life. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. Street angel and house devil. Street of harlots. Street of harlots. Street of harlots after. Streetwalking and soliciting. Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. Strictly confidential. Strictly confidential. Striding past Finn’s hotel Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. Strike up a ballad. Strings. Strong as a brood mare some of those horsey women. Strong curtain. Strongly. Strong man grapses woman’s wrist. Strong pair of arms. Struggle for life is the law of existence but but human philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. Stubborn as a mule! Stuck. Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck. Stuck, the flies buzzed. Stuck together! Stuff them up with meat and drink. Stuffy it was. Stunned like, seeing as how no shiners is acoming. Stupefies them first. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. Subject, what is in this snuffbox? Subleader for his death written this long time perhaps. Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s, bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with O’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. Substantially. Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university. Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame’s school and the high school. Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Successor to my famous brother! Such a bad headache. Such an appeal will touch him. Such as? Such as never? Such as not? Such a... what should he say?... such a queenly mien. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Such is life in an outhouse. Such persons always have. Sucking duck eggs by God till further orders. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Suck your blood dry, they does. Sudden bent. Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton’s desk. Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull. Suddenly he turned to Stephen:
—He knows you. Suffered untold misery. Suffer then. SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY... Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof. Sufflaminandus sum. Suicide. Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained selfinflicted, not impossibly. Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed. Sully my innocence! Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where. Sulphur. Sulphur dung of lions! Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder. Sunburst on the titlepage. Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Sunk by war specials. Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor. Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind. Sun or wind. Sun’s heat it is. Sunwarm silk. Suppose. Suppose. Supposed to be well connected. Suppose he gave her money. Suppose he hit me. Suppose he lost the pin of his. Suppose he was consumptive. Suppose I spoke to her. Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across. Suppose it’s the only time we cross legs, seated. Suppose I when I was? Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first? Suppose she does? Suppose she was gone when he? Suppose she were the? Suppose she wouldn’t let herself be vaccinated again. Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. Suppose there’s some connection. Suppose they wouldn’t feel anything after. Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. Sure? Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king’s expense. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Sure he’s not down in Strasburg terrace with his aunt Sally? Sure, he’s out in John of God’s off his head, poor man. —Sure I’m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff. Surely, there ought to be. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. Sure thing. Sure to know someone on the gate. —Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the language myself. —Sure, you’d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours. Sure you won’t, ma’amsir. Surfeit. Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. Suspiciously. SUSY: Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over! Swagger around livery stables. Swallow? Swans from Anna Liffey swim down here sometimes to preen themselves. —Sweat of my brow, says Joe. Sweeeet song. Sweep! Sweep for that matter. —Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water... Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood. Sweet are the sweets. Sweetheart, goodbye! Sweetheart, goodbye! Sweet lemony wax. Sweet name too: caramel. Sweets of sin. —Sweets of Sin, he said, tapping on it. Sweets to the. Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers. Swell blowout. Swell of her calf. Swell the bust. Sweny’s in Lincoln place. SWENY: Three and a penny, please. Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone. Swill till eleven. Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. Swindle in it somewhere. —Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Switch off the current, will you? Swurls, he says. Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. Symbols too of beauty and of power. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. Sympathetic human man he is. Sympathetic listener. Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature. Synge has promised me an article for Dana too. Ta an bad ar an tir. Table: able. Tableau! Tableau! Table talk. Tail gone now. Taim in mo shagart. Tainted game. Take! —Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself. Take all, keep all. —Take a what? says I. Take care they didn’t lift anything off him. Take down his trousers without loss of time. Take her for me. Take him in tow, platter face and a large apron. Take me out of my way. Taken a few years since. Taken a little more than is good for him. Take no notice. —Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined. Take off that white hat. Take off the rough dirt. Take one Spanish onion. Take out sheet notepaper, envelope: unconcerned. —Take page four, advertisement for Bransome’s coffee, let us say. Takes it for granted we’re going to pop off first. Take some slips from the counter going out. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Take that! Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words. Take the train there tomorrow. Take this. Take thou this noble. Taking a man from another woman. Taking it easy with hand under his cheek. Taking my motives he twined and turned them. Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk. Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Taking what belongs to us by right. Talbot asked simply, bending forward. Talbot repeated:
—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,
 Through the dear might... Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel. Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school. Talk. Talk. Talk about apple dumplings, piuttosto. Talk: as if that would mend matters. Talking about hanging, I’ll show you something you never saw. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. —Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder... —Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match? Talking of one thing or another. Talking through his bloody hat. Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup. Tally ho. Tame essence of Wilde. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them. Tankard loved the song that Mina. Tankards and miss Kennedy. Tank one believed: miss Kenn when she: that doll he was: she doll: the tank. Tanks you. Tan shoes. Tansy and pennyroyal. Tantalising for the poor dead. Tante belle cose! Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap blind walked tapping by the tap the curbstone tapping, tap by tap. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. Tap
—Very, Mr Dedalus said, staring hard at a headless sardine. Tap with it: they do. Tara. Tara. Tara: bom bom bom. Tara street. Tara tara. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M’Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? Taree tara. —Tarentum, sir. Tarnally dog gone my shins if this beent the bestest puttiest longbreak yet. Taste it better because I’m not thirsty. —Taste it, sir, she said. Tastes? Tastes all different for him. Tastes fuller this weather with the chill off. Tattered pages. —Tatters! —Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. T. Caulfield Irwin. Tea. Tea. Tea. Tea. Tea before you put milk in. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Tear it limb from limb. Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes on to the scone. Technic. Tee dash ar most courageous mariner. Teeth getting worse and worse. Telegram! Telegram! —Telegram! he said. Telegraph. —Telegraph! Tell about places you have been, strange customs. Tell a cram, that. Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep. Tell her I was axing at her. Tell her: more and more: all. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve in tears on the bench. —Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. Tell him if he smokes he won’t grow. Tell him I’m Boylan with impatience. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I’ll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects. Tell him that straight from the stable. Tell me all. Tell me I want to. —Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly. —Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book, what is a pier. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Tell me that. Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. Tell me who made the world. Tell mother you’ll be there. Tell Pat you saw me, won’t you? —Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea. Tell us. —Tell us a story, sir. Tell us, Florry. —Tell us if you’re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said. Tell us in plain words. Tell us news. Tell us, there’s a dear. —Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Tell you what it is. —Tell you what, M’Coy said. Temple, two lunches. —Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. Tempting fruit. Tempting poor simple males. Ten bob I got for Molly’s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street. Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring. Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain. Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. Ten, did you say? Ten minutes. —Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch. Tenors get wom. Tenors get women by the score. Ten shillings. Ten shillings? Ten shillings. Ten shillings? Ten shillings! Ten shillings a time. Ten shillings for the gardener. Tension makes them nervous. Tentacles: octopus. Ten thousand pounds. —Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. Tention. Ten to. Ten to one bar one! Ten to one bar one! Ten to one bar one! Ten to one bar one! Ten to one the field. Ten to one the field! Ten years ago: ninetyfour he died yes that’s right the big fire at Arnott’s. —Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. Terence O’Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. Ternoon. Terribilia meditans. Terrible! Terrible. Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion. Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Terrible, terrible! Terrific explosions they are. Terry! Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and passed in and up the stairs. Test: turns blue litmus paper red. Te Virid. Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it. Thalatta! Thalatta! Thanked be Almighty God. Thankful for small mercies. Thanking her stars she was passed over. Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns. Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks awfully muchly. Thanks be to God he’s not paid yet. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Thanks be to God we have it in the house, what, eh, do you follow me? —Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman. Thanks in silence. Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s seaside girls. —Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Thanks, old man. —Thanks, old man, Hynes said. Thanks, Sargent answered. —Thanks, sir. Thanks, somewhat eminent sir. —Thanks, Stephen said. Thanks, that was heavenly. Thanks to the Little Flower. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. —Thank you. Thank you. —Thank you, he said shortly. —Thank you, my miss. —Thank you, no, says Bloom. Thank you: not having any. Thank your mother for the rabbits. —Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. —Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers. —Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette. —Thank you, the sailor said. Thank you very much, gentlemen. —Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. —Thanky vous, Lenehan said, helping himself. That afternoon of the inquest. That alderman sir Leo Bloom’s speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That a man’s soul after he dies. That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father. That antiquated commode. That archduke Leopold was it no yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs? That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void. That awful cramp in Lad lane. That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday. That beetles o’er his base into the sea, isn’t it? That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... —That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented. That Blavatsky woman started it. That bloody old fool! That boggles ’em. That book by the Belgian jesuit, Le Nombre des Élus, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. That book I must change for her. That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white. That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage. That buttermilk didn’t agree with me. —That can be explained by science, says Bloom. That causes movement. That chap in the Burton, gummy with gristle. —That chap? says the citizen. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it? —That covers my case, says Joe. —That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking. That day! That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. That doctrine of laissez faire which so often in our history. —That do? he asked, turning. That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal’s chest. That fell. —That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g. p. i. That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended on it. That fellow spoke. That fellow that turned queen’s evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning. That gave him the leg up. That gentleman from Sport was in looking for you. That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. That give you a hardon? That gouger M’Coy stopping me to say nothing. That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the City Arms with the letter em on her forehead. That haunting sense kind of drew you. That hectic flush spells finis for a man. That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall. That he now poised that it now throbbed. That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year, disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language. That holds them like birdlime. That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money. —That I had, he said, pushing it by. That is fine, isn’t it? That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve? That is his appropriate sun. That is his tragedy. That is how poets write, the similar sounds. That is Kevin Egan’s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep. —That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted. That is so. That is to say he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. That is to say she. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word. That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours. —That is where Childs was murdered, he said. That is why mystic monks. That is why the speech his lean unlovely English is always turned elsewhere, backward. —That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence. That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman. That keeps him alive. That Kilkenny People in the national library now I must. That last day idea. That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne. That letter to father provincial. That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably. That likes me well. That’ll be all right. That’ll be all right. That’ll be all right. That’ll be all right. —That’ll be all right, he said. —That’ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. That’ll be two pounds ten about two pounds eight. —That’ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also. —That’ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said. That’ll do, Ned. That’ll do now. That’ll go in. That lotion, remember. That makes three and a penny. That makes you wild, don’t it? That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne’s house. That man is Leopold M’Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. That man led me, spoke. —That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence... —That may be too, Stephen said. That means the transmigration of souls. That memory, Venus and Adonis, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. —That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet’s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato’s. —That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. That Moore is Martyn’s wild oats? That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. That must be why the women go after them. That night in the Antient Concert Rooms. That night she met... —That old pelters, the editor said. That one. —That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good. That one at the Grosvenor this morning. That one day he will come again. That one is going too. That one, is it? says Chris Callinan, sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick. —That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets. That orangeflower water is so fresh. That or the customhouse. That phrase the world had remembered. That Portrait of Mr W. H. where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues. That priest. That quack doctor for the clap used to be stuck up in all the greenhouses. —That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today. —That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. That republicanism is the best form of government. That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. That rules the world. That’s a fact. —That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher. —That’s a fine old custom, he said. —That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable stiletto. That’s a good one. —That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes. That’s all right. That’s all right. That’s all right. —That’s all right, citizen, says Joe. —That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. That’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you in toto there. That’s an almanac picture for you. —That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son. That’s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir. That’s a straw. That’s better. That’s copy. That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel, eh? —That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. That’s for the chimney. That’s good news. That’s her perfume. —That’s how it’s worked, says the citizen. That’s how that wise man what’s his name with the burning glass. That’s how the Russians prays. That’s in their theology or the priest won’t give the poor woman the confession, the absolution. That, sir, was once a prosperous cit. That’s it. —That’s it, he said. That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal. That’s joyful I can feel. That’s marriage does, their wives. That’s me in mourning. —That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman. That’s music too. That’s my programme. That’s not English. That’s not for you to say, says I. That’s not life for men and women, insult and hatred. That’s not Mulcahy, says he, whoever done it. —That so? —That so? That so? —That so? says Joe. That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now. That’s press. That squinty one is delicate. That’s quite right, sir. That’s quite true. That’s right. —That’s right, Father Cowley said. —That’s right, Ned Lambert said. —That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. —That’s right, the sailor said. That’s saint Augustine. —That’s so, says Martin. That’s talent. That’s terrible for her. That’s the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. That’s the bucko that’ll organise her, take my tip. That’s the chat. That’s the fascination: the name. That’s the first sign when the hairs come out grey. That’s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs. That’s the juggle on which the p.p.’s raise the wind on false pretences. —That’s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered. That’s the maxim of the law. That’s the moon. That’s the music of the future. —That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. That’s the secret of it. —That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone. That’s the vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man. That’s the way to find out. That’s the whole secret. —That’s too bad, says Bloom. That strained look on her face! That’s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter. That suits your book, eh? That’s well known. That’s what good salesman is. That’s what he is. That’s what life is after all. That’s what they enjoy. —That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan. That’s where I hails from. That’s where I hails from. That’s where Molly can knock spots off them. That’s why. That’s why. That’s why he gets them. That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian. That’s why she’s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. That’s why she won’t. That’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you. That’s witty, I think. That’s work too. That’s your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student. —That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth. That that was so. That the coffin was filled with stones. That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the the known... That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom. That the language question should take precedence of the economic question. —That the lay you’re on now? says Joe. That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain. That three shillings you can keep. That tickles me, I must say. That tired feeling. That touches a man’s inmost heart. That voice was a lamentation. That was a brilliant idea, Bob. That was a nice nun there, really sweet face. That was a pen. That was a rare bit of horseflesh. That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. —That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently. That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose. That was in his eyes. That was just like Cissycums. That was Mr Dignam, my father. That was one for him. That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile. —That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road. That was that chap’s name. That was the first night. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell. That was the night... That was the rub. That was the rule, said. That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known. That was the talk of the town that year Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times, breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror. That was to say he had heard the name of. That was two and nine. That was why he asked me to. That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives. —That was Will’s way, John Eglinton defended. That was your contribution to literature. That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet. That weal there is an accident. That we live after death. —That what’s I mean, says the citizen. That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer’s that looked at me. That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany. —That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly. That will be worth seeing, faith. That will do. —That will do, Mr Deasy said. —That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. That will do nicely. —That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. That woman at midnight mass. That wonderworker if I had. That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the. That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds. That would do to: man always feels complimented. That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness. That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. That wrong? That you may and very opportunely. That young doctor O’Hare I noticed her brushing his coat. That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother’s thought. That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee—and in vain. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a prima facie and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten or doghaired infants occasionally born. —The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended. The accused will now make a bogus statement. —The ace of spades! —The act of a hero, he said. The act of low scoundrels. The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt’s plague which in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper ubi and quomodo. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here. The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend. The ages succeed one another. The agony in the closet. The air feeds most. The air in firmer waltz time sounds. The air is perfumed with essences. The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny coelum. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands. The alchemists. The anchor’s weighed. The annual dinner, you know. The answer is a lemon. THE ANSWERS: Round behind the stable. The answer to the honourable member’s question is in the affirmative. The apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had. The Arabian Nights Entertainment was my favourite and Red as a Rose is She. The archconspirator of the age! The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers was easily distinguishable. THE ARTANE ORPHANS:
     You hig, you hog, you dirty dog! The artistic. —The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. The ashplant marks his stride. The assistants leap at the victim’s legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boy’s tongue protrudes violently. —The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power. The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. The aunt thinks you killed your mother. —The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps. THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS:
     Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
     Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables. —The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells, floated under by the bridgepiers. The banknotes, blast them. —The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. The barrow had ceased to trundle. The barrow turned into a side lane. The Bath of the Nymph over the bed. THE BAWD: Her voice whispering huskily. THE BAWD: Her wolfeyes shining. THE BAWD: Jewman’s melt! THE BAWD: Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. THE BAWD: Listen to who’s talking! The bawd makes an unheeded sign. THE BAWD: Spits in their trail her jet of venom. THE BAWD: Ten shillings a maidenhead. THE BAWD: The red’s as good as the green. The bay purple by the Lion’s head. The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden. The beast that has two backs at midnight. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students’ gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching. THE BEATITUDES: Incoherently. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom. The Beauties of Killarney wrappers. The beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice. THE BELLS: Haltyaltyaltyall. THE BELLS: Heigho! The bells of George’s church. The bells of George’s church toll slowly, loud dark iron. The belly is the smoothest. The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope. —The best death, Mr Bloom said. The best, in fact. The best obtainable. The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to. The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons. The bible! The bird that can sing and won’t sing. THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR: I here present your undoubted emperor-president and king-chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son. The black north and true blue bible. The black panther! The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father. —The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen. —The blessings of God on you! The blind of the window was drawn aside. The blinds drawn. The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. The blind stripling did not answer. The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again. The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form. The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing. The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil. 
 The blond girl in Thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre. The blond girl’s slim fingers reckoned the fruits. The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne. The bloodiest old tartar God ever made. The blood it is. The bloody mongrel began to growl that’d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs. The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street. The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. The blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear. The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain. The body feels the atmosphere. The body to be exhumed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked:
—What is it? The bold soldier boy. The bomb is here. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot. THE BOOTS: Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers. The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. The Botanic Gardens are just over there. The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five. The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The boy’s blank face asked the blank window. The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:
—O, sir. THE BRACELETS: Heigho! The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes. The brake cracks violently. The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle. The bride who was given away by her father, the M’Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. —The bright stars fade... The bright stars fade. The broadcloth back ascended each step: back. The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men’s grey and green socks and brogues, floursmeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door. The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand. The Bruce’s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York’s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned. THE BUCKLES: Love me. The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pig’s knuckle between his molars through which rabid scumspittle dribbles. The bulldog of Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth. —The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. The Burton. The Butter exchange band. THE BUTTON: Bip! The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in London somewhere. THE CALLS: Wait, my love, and I’ll be with you. THE CALUMET OF PEACE
 He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a large mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof, then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. The candour, nudity, pose, tranquility, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus purchased by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor’s Walk. The cane moved out trembling to the left. THE CAP: Bah! THE CAP: Which? THE CAP: Which? THE CAP: With saturnine spleen. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn. The carcass lay on his path. The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles. The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped. The carriage halted short. The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying. The carriage moved on through the drove. The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. The carriage steered left for Finglas road. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane. The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently. The carriage wheeling by Farrell’s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees. The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street. The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door. The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing. The cat mewed to him. The cat-o’-nine-tails. The cat’s ramble through the slag. The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high. The cat went up in soft bounds. The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the insentient material of a strainveined timber table. The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays. The ceremony which went off with great éclat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. The change of name. THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS: Hear! The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. The chap that writes like Synge. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms. The chemist turned back page after page. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. THE CHILDREN: Kithogue! The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. THE CHILDREN: Where’s the great light? The Child’s Guide blue cloth. THE CHIMES: Turn again, Leopold! THE CHOIR:
     Liliata rutilantium te confessorum... The chords consented. The chords harped slower. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter bound their affections too with hoops of steel. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of light, born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the plane of buddhi. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The cigarette slips from Stephen’s fingers. The circulation stops. THE CIRCUMCISED: In dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers. THE CITIZEN: Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler. THE CITIZEN: Erin go bragh! The citizen made a grab at the letter. The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner. THE CITIZEN: Thank heaven! THE CITIZEN: With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls. The Clarence, Dolphin. The clay fell softer. The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with submerged petrified city, the Giant’s Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of royal Meath, Brigid’s elm in Kildare, the Queen’s Island shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney. The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest’s house cooed where Canon O’Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S. J. were taking tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton chops with catsup and talking about
     Cuckoo
     Cuckoo
     Cuckoo. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit. The cloven sex. The clumsy things are dear at a sou. The coals were reddening. The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners. The coffin they brought over was full of stones. The cold domed room of the tower waits. The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn. The cold smell of sacred stone called him. The cold steel pen. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin at first no bigger than a woman’s hand. The colleen bawn. The college curriculum. The colours were done something lovely. The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in the cerebral convolutions. The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her. The constant readers’ room. The contrary no. The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh. The coroner’s sunlit ears, big and hairy. The corpsechewer! The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night. The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment. The couples fall aside. The courthouse is a blind. The cracked lookingglass of a servant. THE CRIER: Loudly. THE CRIER: Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid! The crone makes back for her lair, swaying her lamp. The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack. The Croppy Boy. THE CROPPY BOY:
     Horhot ho hray hor hother’s hest. THE CROPPY BOY: The ropenoose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands. The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. The crowd bawls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. THE CROWD:
     Card of the races. The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane. THE CROWD: Let him up! —The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said. THE CROZIER AND THE PEN
—His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely. The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue somebody having a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog breed unknown with a lame paw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. The Cuckoos’ Rest! The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it. The curate served. The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores’ gets! The curse of my curses
     Seven days every day
     And seven dry Thursdays
     On you, Barney Kiernan,
     Has no sup of water
     To cool my courage,
     And my guts red roaring
     After Lowry’s lights. The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius. THE DARK MERCURY: The Castle is looking for him. The daughters of Erin, in black garments, with large prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray. THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN:
     Kidney of Bloom, pray for us
     Flower of the Bath, pray for us
     Mentor of Menton, pray for us
     Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us
     Charitable Mason, pray for us
     Wandering Soap, pray for us
     Sweets of Sin, pray for us
     Music without Words, pray for us
     Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us
     Friend of all Frillies, pray for us
     Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us
     Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us. —The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goatfell cloaks arise and appear to many. The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what’s in fashion. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. The death struggle. The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital. The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life. The deceased gentleman was a most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a brief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeply regretted. The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal wisdom, Plato’s world of ideas. The deep white breast. The Deity aint no nickel dime bumshow. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane, Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Señor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. The demon possessed me. The Denzille lane boys. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come Back to Erin, followed immediately by Rakóczsy’s March. The devil and the deep sea. The devil on moneylenders. The devil wouldn’t stop him. —The dewdrops pearl... The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation. The disc rasps gratingly against the needle. The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six. The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk. The distant hills seem. The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis. —The divine afflatus, Mr O’Madden Burke said. The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting. The dog’s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning. The door! The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. The door closed. The door closed behind the outgoer. THE DOORHANDLE: Theeee! The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in. The door of Ruttledge’s office creaked again. The door of Ruttledge’s office whispered: ee: cree. The door of the bar. The door opens. The doorway was darkened by an entering form. The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane. The dour recluse still there he has his cake and the douce youngling, minion of pleasure, Phedo’s toyable fair hair. The drain, you mean. The dreamy cloudy gull
     Waves o’er the waters dull. The dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, to be married by Father Maher. The drone of his misleading whistle brings Walter back. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. The drunken little costdrawer and his brother, the cornet player. THE DUMMYMUMMY: Bbbbblllllblblblblobschbg! —The dust from those sacks, J. J. O’Molloy said politely. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. The earl of Dublin, no less. The earth. The earth trembles. The eastern seas. THE ECHO: Fool! THE ECHO: Sham! The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. The editor’s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom’s face, shadowed by a smile. The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering. The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject, a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start. The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. The end. The end comes suddenly. The end of the world! THE END OF THE WORLD: With a Scotch accent. The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip. The ends of the world with a Scotch accent. The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. —The European family, says J. J.... —The Evening Telegraph... The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. The exotic, you see. The eye, like that. The eye sees all flat. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling. The eyes that wish me well. The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together. The face at the window! The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. The face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin’s Barn. The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeare’s beardless face. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall. The faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship, ringroundabout him. The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction. The false priest rustling soldier from his cassock. The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway. THE FAN: Flirting quickly, then slowly. THE FAN: Folded akimbo against her waist. THE FAN: Folding together, rests against her left eardrop. THE FAN: Half opening, then closing. THE FAN: Points downwards quickly. THE FAN: Points downwards slowly. THE FAN: Tapping. THE FAN: Tapping. The far east. The fashionable international world attended en masse this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. The Father and the Son idea. The father is rotto with money. —The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother-in-law of Chris Callinan. The fauna. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink. The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. THE FIGURE: Impassive, raises a signal arm. The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him. The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James, the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George’s street, south, the latter at his 6 1/2d shop and world’s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility divined, horizontally of maximum legibility deciphered and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide. The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society. —The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character. THE FIRE BRIGADE: Pflaap! The firing squad. The first fellow that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon’s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen’s mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation. The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling:
—Racing special! The first night after the charades. The first night at Mat Dillon’s! The first, said she and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear, the first is a bath... The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with O. Madden up. The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside. The fleeing nymph raises a keen. The flood is following me. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. The flowers that bloom in the spring. The flow of the language it is. The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. THE FLYBILL: K. 11. The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove. The foreman moved his pencil towards it. The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly. The foreman thought for an instant. The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket. The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter. The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money £ 1-7-0, one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former. The fox and the grapes, is it? The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun. The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The French point of view. —The French! says the citizen. The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us. The froeken, bonne à tout faire, who rubs male nakedness in the bath at Upsala. The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there is a new moon. The funeral is today. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. THE GAFFER: Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout. The galling chain. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. THE GASJET: Pooah! THE GASJET: Pwfungg! The gasjet wails whistling. The gas we had on the Toft’s hobbyhorses. The gates glimmered in front: still open. The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade. The gate was open. The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. The gentle art of advertisement. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock. The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three... allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate... who’s touching it?... ow! The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed. The ghostcandle to light her agony. The girl there. The glasses would take their fancy, flashing. The Glencree dinner. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. The glow leaps again. The god pursuing the maiden hid. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. THE GONG: Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo. The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech. The Gordon Bennett. The grainy sand had gone from under his feet. THE GRAMOPHONE: Drowning his voice. THE GRAMOPHONE:
     Jerusalem! —The grand canal, he said. The grandest number, Stephen, in the whole opera. THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME
—Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it. The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin. The gravediggers touched their caps. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. —The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added. THE GREAT GALLAHER
—You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis. The great physician called him home. —The Greek! he said again. The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer. The greeneyed monster. The green light wanes to mauve. THE GREEN LODGES: Soft day, sir John! The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself. The grub is ready. The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less. The gules doublet and merry saint George for me! THE GULLS: Kaw kave kankury kake. The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from their heights, pouncing on prey. —The gunboat, the keeper said. The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. THE HALCYON DAYS: Mackerel! The hall. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. The hand that rocks the cradle. The harlot’s cry from street to street
     Shall weave old England’s windingsheet. The harping chords of prelude closed. The harp that once did starve us all. The harp that once or twice. The hat trick! The hawklike man. The hazard. The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom’s gullet. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists. —The height of fine society. The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. The Hidden Life of Christ black boards. The hideous old wretch! The high hall of Horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic. The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town. The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company’s timekeeper bawled them off:
—Rathgar and Terenure! THE HOBGOBLIN: His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs. The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor. The holy father. The home without potted meat is incomplete. The honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man. THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly. THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Laughs derisively. THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of fury. THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently. THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Very much so! THE HOOF: If you bungle, Handy Andy, I’ll kick your football for you. THE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide. The horse harness jingles. The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds. THE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! The horse neighs. THE HORSE: Neighs. The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. The horse was just then. The hottest stuff ever was. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. The house rises. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was. THE HUE AND CRY: Helterskelterpelterwelter. The huguenots brought that here. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful, more than all others. The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close. The hungry famished gull
     Flaps o’er the waters dull. The husband was a captain or an officer. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of. —The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. THE IDIOT: Gobbling. THE IDIOT: Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles. The image of a solitary ipsorelative mutable aliorelative man. The image of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. The images of other males of his blood will repel him. The impact. —The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church. The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed. The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he Bloom had marked a florin 2/- with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return. The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius. The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions Semitic and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing Celtic. The incumbent they called him. The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore. The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop. The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow’s Physical Strength and How to Obtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility. The inferno has no terrors for me. The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. The intellectual imagination! Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. Their bodies plunge. Their butteries and larders. Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying. Their character. Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord. Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides. Their Eldorado. Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh. Their eyes watched him. Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see. Their frugal meal. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss. Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir. Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren’s auction. The Irish Beekeeper. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. The Irish catholic peasant. THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS: In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs. —The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman’s friend. The Irishman’s house is his coffin. Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males. Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle. Their little frolic after meals. Their lives. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Their natural craving. Their paintspeckled hats wag. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Their Pali book we tried to pawn. The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler’s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he Bloom was his the clown’s papa. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head. Theirs not to reason why. Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. —Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. Their upper jaw they move. Their wide open eyes looked at him. Their wigs to show the grey matter. —The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces. The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand. The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses. The jarvies raised their hats. The jejune jesuit! The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: It is meet to be here. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. The joy of creation... The joy the feel the warm the. THE JURORS: All their heads lowered in assent. THE JURORS: All their heads turned to his voice. The Katty Lanner step. The keeper of the Kildare street museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos, Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor, Publicity, Manufacture, Liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People. The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tête-à-tête put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. —The kettle is boiling, he said. The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. —The kidney! he cried suddenly. —The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many. The king’s friends God bless His Majesty! shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me. The King’s own. The king was in his countinghouse. The kips? THE KISSES: Warbling. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing. The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly:
—Bang! The lacquey banged loudly. THE LACQUEY: Barang! 
 The lacquey by the door of Dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet. The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:
—Barang! The lacquey rang his bell. The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. —The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. The lamp’s broken. The landlord has the prior. The landlord has the prior claim. The lane is safer. The language of course was another thing. The last act. The last articles... The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. The last house. The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney’s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. The last straw. The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth human tempered with coolness linen, obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire. The latter, by the line of least resistance. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. —The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected. The lean old ones tougher. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. The least tholice. The lefthand dead shot. The left hand nearest the heart. The Leith police dismisseth us. The letter. The letter is not mine. The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. The lights change, glow, fade gold rosy violet. The light touch. The likes of her! The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors. The élite. The little house. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes. THE LOITERERS: Guffaw with cleft palates. THE LOITERERS: Jays, that’s a good one. The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man. The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock’s wattles. —The Lord forgive me! The Lord has spoken to Malachi. —The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot. The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music. The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation. The lost armada is his jeer in Love’s Labour Lost. The lovely name you. The love that kills. The lower register, for choice. The lump I have is useless. The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The Lyons mail. Them. [ 15 ]
 The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled tramsiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o’-the-wisps and danger signals. The machines clanked in threefour time. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. The maid was in the garden. The Malaga raisins. The Malahide road was quiet. THE MALE BRUTES: Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro. The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. The man in the macintosh disappears. THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH: Don’t you believe a word he says. The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court. The man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. The man that got away James Stephens. The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. The man that was drowned. The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden’s rock. The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. The man upstairs is dead. Them are his trousers I’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. —Them are two good ones, he said. The marquee umbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. The Mater Misericordiae. The melon he had he held against my face. —The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom. The men came to handigrips. The men cheer. The Messiah was first given for that. The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. The midnight sun is darkened. —The milk, sir! The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. The mimber? The minor was proved by the major. The mirror up to nature. The mirror was in shadow. THE MOB: Lynch him! The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious. The mockery of it! —The mockery of it, he said contentedly. —The mockery of it! he said gaily. The moment is now. The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath. The moon. —The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. O’Molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution. The morn. The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing visavis. The morn is breaking. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. —The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. —The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them. The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles. THE MOTHER: A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth. THE MOTHER: Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes. THE MOTHER: Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath. THE MOTHER: In the agony of her deathrattle. THE MOTHER: I pray for you in my other world. THE MOTHER: Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? THE MOTHER: With smouldering eyes. THE MOTHER: With the subtle smile of death’s madness. THE MOTHER: Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately. THE MOTH:
     I’m a tiny tiny thing
     Ever flying in the spring
     Round and round a ringaring. The motion is ended. The motorman bangs his footgong. THE MOTORMAN: Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hat trick? The motorman, thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys. The mourners included: Patk. The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks. The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show. The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed. The movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant’s heart on the hillside. The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. The murderer’s image in the eye of the murdered. The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel. The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion. The Mystery Man on the Beach, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold Bloom. The mystery was unveiled. Then? —Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. Then about six o’clock I can. The nails, yes. Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy. Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers close in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee? Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench. Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against. The name. The name if you call. THE NAMELESS ONE: Bareback riding. THE NAMELESS ONE: Snarls. The name of a decisive battle forgotten, frequently remembered by a decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy remembered. The name on the label is Plumtree. The name too. The name was familiar to him, that is to say. Then and not till then. THE NANNYGOAT: Bleats. Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender. Then a sigh: silence. Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole. THE NAVVY: Belching. THE NAVVY: Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn. THE NAVVY: Shouts. THE NAVVY: Shouts. The navvy, staggering forward, cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. THE NAVVY: Staggering past. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his ribs and groans. Then build them cubicles to end their days in. Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. Then casual wards full after. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head. Thence they advanced five parasangs. Then come out a bit spreeish. Then comes good uncle Leo. Then darkened deathchamber. Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour. Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals. Then dies. Then dried up. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the pages of a book. The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps. The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds of brightness. The new I want. THE NEWSBOYS: Stop press edition. The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born. The New York World cabled for a special. The next one. Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim. Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat. Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:
—The bard’s noserag! Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Then getting it ready. Then giddy woman will run about. Then hastened. Then having to give the breast year after year all hours of the night. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief. Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth. Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work. Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. Then he read the letter again: twice. Then here’s a health to Mulligan’s aunt
     And I’ll tell you the reason why. Then here the name. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:
—What’s your opinion of the times? Then he said to Haines:
—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month. Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance. Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to bring. Then he walked to the other end and shook it again. Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder. Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor. Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. Then I can go after six if you’re not back. The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. Then I don’t know about the next number. Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins. The night hours, one by one, steal to the last place. The night Milly brought it into the parlour. The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s he was still in short trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips. The night she threw the soup in the waiter’s face in the Star and Garter. The night Si sang. —Then I’ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you’ll give it a good place I know. Then in last switchback lumbering up and down bump mashtub sort of viceroy and reine relish for tublumber bumpshire rose. Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles. Then I will tell you all. Then I will tell you all. Then I will tell you all. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then keep them waiting months for their fee. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. Then know. Then lie back to rest. Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then lump them together to save time. Then make it up. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone. Then Mount Jerome for the protestants. Then nay no I have an inkling. Then not till then. —The noblest, the truest, says he. The nocturnal rat peers from his hole. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:
     We are the boys of Wexford
     Who fought with heart and hand. The northeast corner. The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I’ll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from The Two Gentlemen of Verona onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth. The not far distant day. —Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben Dollard said. Then out she comes. Then outspake medical Dick to his comrade medical Davy. Then out there came the jew’s daughter
     And she all dressed in green. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the Star. Then passing over her white skin. Then rambling and wandering. Then rigid with left foot advanced he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder. Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys. Then running round corners. Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends. Then saw like yellow streaks on his face. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Then she mightn’t like it. Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house. Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Then snatch your purse. Then someone said something about the case of the s. s. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, effectu secuto, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides. Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. —Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino. Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:
—For old Mary Ann
 She doesn’t care a damn. —Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. Then tear asunder. Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan’s. Then the decree nisi and the King’s proctor tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, nisi was made absolute. Then the heather goes on fire. Then the insides decompose quickly. Then the next one. Then the next one: a small old woman. Then the next thing on the menu. Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to that effect. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:
—O God, our refuge and our strength... Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college. Then the spring, the summer: smells. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob’s sons. Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November. Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other. Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s name. Then they sang the second verse of the Tantum ergo and Canon O’Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn’t know what to call her. Then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses. Then think of the competition. Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. Then too far. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:
—That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day? Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, arms akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour:
     O, the poor little fellow
     Hihihihihis legs they were yellow
     He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake
     But some bloody savage
     To graize his white cabbage
     He murdered Nell Flaherty’s duckloving drake. The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be. Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word. —Then what is it? Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses’ hoofs. Then who’d wash up all the plates and forks? Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. Then with those Röntgen rays searchlight you could. Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it? THE NYMPH: Bends her head. THE NYMPH: Covers her face with her hands. THE NYMPH: Coyly, through parting fingers. THE NYMPH: During dark nights I heard your praise. THE NYMPH: Eyeless, in nun’s white habit, coif and hugewinged wimple, softly, with remote eyes. THE NYMPH: Her features hardening, gropes in the folds of her habit. THE NYMPH: Her fingers in her ears. THE NYMPH: I do. THE NYMPH: In my presence. THE NYMPH: Loftily. THE NYMPH: Mortal! THE NYMPH: Sadly. THE NYMPH: Softly. THE NYMPH: With a cry flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks. THE NYMPH: With wide fingers. Then you can imagine the style of his discourse. Then you’d sing, Simon, like a garden thrush. Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones’ locker, moon looking down so peaceful. Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved. The objects which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme. The obsequies, at which many friends of the deceased were present, were carried out certainly Hynes wrote it with a nudge from Corny by Messrs H. J. O’Neill and Son, 164 North Strand Road. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. —The O’Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him. The octave. THEODORE PUREFOY: In fishingcap and oilskin jacket. Theodore’s cousin in Dublin Castle. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths. The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road. The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers. The oldest people. The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. The old sow that eats her farrow! The Old Woman of Prince’s street was there first. The one about Hamlet. The one about the bulletin. The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:
—England expects... The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man. The only true thing in life? The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery. The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite. THE ORANGE LODGES: Jeering. Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush. The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up. The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown. The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. —The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. The others turned. The other trotting round with a fare. The oval equine faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrbling to be blooded. The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible. The passing bell is heard. The patriot’s banquet. —The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting. THE PEERS: I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship. The people’s William. The personal note. The phenomenon of ebullition. The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny. THE PIANOLA:
     Best, best of all,
     Baraabum! THE PIANOLA:
     My girl’s a Yorkshire girl. THE PIANOLA:
     My little shy little lass has a waist. THE PIANOLA:
     Though she’s a factory lass
     And wears no fancy clothes. THE PIANOLA:
     Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls,
     Sweethearts they’d left behind... The pianola with changing lights plays in waltz time the prelude of My Girl’s a Yorkshire Girl. The pigs’ paper. The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. The pillar of the cloud appears. The pink edition extra sporting of the Telegraph tell a graphic lie lay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and the preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard was addressed A. Boudin find the captain’s age, his eyes went aimlessly over the respective captions which came under his special province the allembracing give us this day our daily press. The pity of it! The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks. —The play begins. The playhouse sausage filled Gilbert’s soul. The plays of Shakespeare’s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit. The play’s the thing! The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly He gave us light first and the sun two days later, the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call dio boia, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. —The plot thickens, John Eglinton said. The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of agriculture. The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet’s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator. The policeman touched his forehead. The ponderous pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin’s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O’Madden Burke. —The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. The poor wife was awfully cut up. The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. The portico. The portly figure of John O’Connell, caretaker, stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. The possibility of exercising virile power of fascination in the not immediate future after an expensive repast in a private apartment in the company of an elegant courtesan, of corporal beauty, moderately mercenary, variously instructed, a lady by origin. The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter. The powderpuff. The prelude ceases. The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars. The preparation of breakfast burnt offering: intestinal congestion and premeditative defecation holy of holies: the bath rite of John: the funeral rite of Samuel: the advertisement of Alexander Keyes Urim and Thummim: the unsubstantial lunch rite of Melchisedek: the visit to museum and national library holy place: the bookhunt along Bedford row, Merchants’ Arch, Wellington Quay Simchath Torah: the music in the Ormond Hotel Shira Shirim: the altercation with a truculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan’s premises holocaust: a blank period of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking wilderness: the eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism rite of Onan: the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy heave offering: the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance medley in Beaver street Armageddon: nocturnal perambulation to and from the cabman’s shelter, Butt Bridge atonement. The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud Mischna and Ghemara, Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto S. Mary’s Abbey and masshouse Adam and Eve’s tavern: the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution. The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin. The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. The priest he sought. The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the witnessbox. The priest prayed:
—Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. The priest’s at home. The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s bucket and shook it over the coffin. The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly. The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands. The princess Selene, in moonblue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair, borne by two giants. The printed matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. THE PRISON GATE GIRLS:
     If you see Kay
     Tell him he may
     See you in tea
     Tell him from me. The problem is to get money. The proceedings then terminated. The professor came to the inner door. The professor grinned, locking his long lips. The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across Stephen’s and Mr O’Madden Burke’s loose ties. The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath. The propitious moment. The protestants are the same. The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam: the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. The Providential. The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with haste, quake, quack. The quaker librarian springhalted near. The quaker’s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk. The Queen’s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom Rudolf Virag died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood aconite selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street, Ennis after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra smart after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid, at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis. The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled. The quick touch. The quoits are loose. THE QUOITS: Jigjag. The radiance of the intellect. —The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. —The rain kept off. The rams’ horns sound for silence. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel, the musichall song. The R. D. F., with our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign. There? There? There. There. There? There. There. There. The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. There again: the overtone following through the air. The real classical, you know. There all right. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end. —There are great times coming, Mary. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. There are more women than men in the world. There are sins or let us call them as the world calls them evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait. —There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror hey, presto!, he beholdeth himself. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which... Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever. Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium till she was there unmaided. There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. There be many mo. The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part. —There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering. There can be no two opinions on the matter. The reclamation of dunams of waste arenary soil, proposed in the prospectus of Agendath Netaim, Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 15, by the cultivation of orange plantations and melonfields and reafforestation. THE RECORDER: I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking:
—And what might your name be? The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The redlabelled bottle on the table. There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. The reflection that, apart from the letter in question, his magnetic face, form and address had been favourably received during the course of the preceding day by a wife Mrs Josephine Breen, born Josie Powell, a nurse, Miss Callan Christian name unknown, a maid, Gertrude Gerty, family name unknown. Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came. Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client’s family. There he goes. There he goes. There he goes again. There he goes into Frederick street. There he is. —There he is again, says the citizen, staring out. There he is airing his quiff. —There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets. There he is cursing the mate. There he is himself, a Greek. —There he is, Lenehan said. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. —There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause. —There he is, she said. There he is sitting there. There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. There he is: the brother. There he keened a wailing rune. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out. There in the corner. There is a flower that bloometh. There is another world after death named hell. There is a word throstle that expresses that. There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan’s I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan’s song about those seaside girls. There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself. There is no answer. There is no answer. There is no answer; he bends again. There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph. There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence. There is no time to lose. There is not in this wide world a vallee. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. There is something sinister in you.... There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday. —There it is, Red Murray said. There Leop. —There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. —There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom Pubb. There might be other answers lying there. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human mature female to inhuman hotwaterjar calefaction, the stimulation of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress striped and the woollen mattress biscuit section. —There must be a new moon out, she said. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop. There or the armpits or under the neck. The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side of his guest’s jacket. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape. There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and particularly human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There’s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel. There’s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God’s quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street. There’s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. There’s a committee formed. There’s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found. —There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said. —There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card. There’s a good girly now. There’s a great big holy friar. There’s a hurricane blowing. There’s a jew for you! There’s a lemon in the locker. There’s a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test those glasses by. There’s a medium in all things. There’s an example again of simple souls. There’s a priest. There’s a row on. There’s a saying of Goethe’s which Mr Magee likes to quote. There’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset. —There’s a smell of burn, she said. There’s a touch of the artist about old Bloom. —There’s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it’s not moving. There’s a word I wanted to ask you. There’s eleven of them. There’s fine depth for you! —There’s five fathoms out there, he said. There’s hair. —There’s hair, Joe, says I. There she goes. There she is with them down there for the fireworks. There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside. There’s Hornblower standing at the porter’s lodge. —There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. There’s music everywhere. There’s my discharge. There’s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money. There’s nobody like him after all. There’s no excuse for him! There’s no-one. There’s no-one. There’s no-one as blind as the fellow that won’t see, if you know what that means. There’s no-one in it only her old father that’s dead drunk. There’s no straight sport going now. There’s nothing in the way. There’s nothing smutty in it. There’s nothing wrong with him except at night. There’s not sixpenceworth of damage done. —There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf. —There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said. There’s something up. —There’s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There’s the sun again coming out. There’s the widow. The rest shall keep as they are. The resurrection and the life. There’s whatdoyoucallhim out of. —There’s your snotrag, he said. There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom. Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly Etienne chanson but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea. The retriever approaches sniffing, nose to the ground. THE RETRIEVER: Barking. THE RETRIEVER: Barking furiously. The retriever barks. The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail. The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily. The reverend Carrion Crow. The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon. —The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don’t you think? —The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles. THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE: Raises high behind the celebrant’s petticoat, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck. THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE: To the devil which hath made glad my young days. The Reverend Mr Hugh C Haines Love M. A. in a plain cassock and mortarboard, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrant’s head an open umbrella. The reverend Mr Love. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will D.V. speak. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity. There was. —There was a battle, sir. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon for a bob. There was a fellow I knew once in Barcelona, queer fellow, used to call it his postprandial. —There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month. —There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were both..... —There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly. There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were in Lombard street west. There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly hauteur about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep. There was a right royal old nigger. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand. There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sir Leopold. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow. There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in his matters, says he. —There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said. —There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts. There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. There was none to come up to her for fun. There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that. —There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing. There was something on his mind, I saw. There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the coup d’œil was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar. There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails. There were sunspots that summer. There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently au fait. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn some time. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history. —There you are, says Terry. The rhododendrons. The rich of a rasher fried with a herring? The right honourable Hedges Eyre Chatterton. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson’s all times ticking watches and Henry and James’s wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered. The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. The rite is the poet’s rest. The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot on our shore he never set it only his cloacal obsession. The room in the hotel with hunting pictures. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones. The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire. The Rows of Casteele. The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. The royal reader. The ruffin cly the nab of Stephen Hand as give me the jady coppaleen. The Russians, they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese. The sack of windy Troy. The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. —The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said. The sage repeated: Lex talionis. The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides. The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears. The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water. The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:
—You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you? The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. —The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. The same young eyes. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating, reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before. —The school kip? —The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely. The scientific. The scrotumtightening sea. The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs. The seabirds screaming. These are handy things to have. The seas’ ruler. The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins. The seat he sat on: warm. The sea they think they hear. The Sea Venture comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin’s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen’s father and Stephen’s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older. The Secret History of the Court of Charles II red cloth, tooled binding. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared... The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here. —The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton. The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. These opening bars he sang and translated extempore. These pots we have to wear. The server piped the answers in the treble. These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old. The sewage. The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O’Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark. The shape is there still. THE SHEBEENKEEPER: Purdon street. —The sheeny! The sheeted mirror. The shepherd’s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. The shining seven W.B. calls them. The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood. —The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. The Ship, half twelve. The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter. The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum. The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing. The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank. The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober, two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. The sighing voice of sorrow sang. THE SIGHTSEERS: Dying. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. The simple pleasures of the poor. THE SINS OF THE PAST: In a medley of voices. The sins of your past are rising against you. The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town. The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor. The sky. The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind. The slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights. The Sluagh na h-Eireann. The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS: Screaming. THE SLUTS:
     O, Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
     He didn’t know what to do,
     To keep it up,
     To keep it up. The snotgreen sea. THE SOAP:
     We’re a capital couple are Bloom and I. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett’s jaw. The soldier hit him. The soldiers turn their swimming eyes. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots. The Son striving to be atoned with the Father. The son unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases care. The Sorrows of Satan he calls it. —The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear. The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade. The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George. The speaker: Order! The sphincter loose. The spider pitches her web in the solitude. The spiked and winding cold seahorn. The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to. —The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed. The splendid proportions of hips, bosom. The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them. The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber. The squallers. The squeak is out. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. The standard of Zion is hoisted. The Stark-Munro Letters by A. Conan Doyle, property of the City of Dublin Public Library, 106 Capel street, lent 21 May Whitsun Eve 1904, due 4 June 1904, 13 days overdue black cloth binding, bearing white letternumber ticket. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. The stiff walk. The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. The stonecutter’s yard on the right. The Story of the Heavens by Sir Robert Ball blue cloth. —The strangers, says the citizen. The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a flair, for the cruder things of life. The strength it gives a man. The subsheriff Long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay. The sugared sonnets follow Sidney’s. The sugar is in the bag. [ 13 ]
 The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace. The sum was done. The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the silverware opposite in Walter Sexton’s window by which John Howard Parnell passed, unseeing. The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses. The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church. [ 10 ]
 The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S. J. reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. The supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. The swan of Avon has other thoughts. The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s high grade ha. The sweepings of every country including our own. The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her. The sweets of sin. The sweets of sin. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood. The tank. The tear is bloody near your eye. The tea was drawn. The telephone rang rudely by her ear. The telephone whirred. The telephone whirred inside. —The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings. The temper of him! The tentacles... The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail. The third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize. The 113th, modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de populo barbaro. The thoughts. The thought that the other chap pays best sauce in the world. The three brothers Shakespeare. The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. The threemaster Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks. THE THREE WHORES: Covering their ears, squawk. The thrill they itch for. THE TIMEPIECE: Unportalling. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay. The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun’s disk. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth. THE TORCHBEARERS: Hooray! The touch of a deadhand cures. The traitor’s son. The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School 1880 had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure. The tram passed. —The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. The tree of forbidden priest. The tribune’s words, howled and scattered to the four winds. The trick doorhandle turns. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with. The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client’s native place, the land of the Pharaoh. The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense. —The truth is midway, he affirmed. The truth, spit it out. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson. —The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player. —The turf, Lenehan put in. The turnstile. The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding. The twilight hours advance from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. The twining stresses, two by two. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The two maries. The two whores rush to the halldoor. The tympanum. The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel. The ultimate return. The unexpected discovery of an object of great monetary value precious stone, valuable adhesive or impressed postage stamps 7 schilling, mauve, imperforate, Hamburg, 1866: 4 pence, rose, blue paper, perforate, Great Britain, 1855: 1 franc, stone, official, rouletted, diagonal surcharge, Luxemburg, 1878, antique dynastical ring, unique relic in unusual repositories or by unusual means: from the air dropped by an eagle in flight, by fire amid the carbonised remains of an incendiated edifice, in the sea amid flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict, on earth in the gizzard of a comestible fowl. The unfair sex. The unfortunate yahoos believe it. The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing. The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow. THE URCHINS: Mind out, mister! The Useful Ready Reckoner brown cloth. The utilisation of waste paper, fells of sewer rodents, human excrement possessing chemical properties, in view of the vast production of the first, vast number of the second and immense quantity of the third, every normal human being of average vitality and appetite producing annually, cancelling byproducts of water, a sum total of 80 lbs. mixed animal and vegetable diet, to be multiplied by 4,386,035, the total population of Ireland according to census returns of 1901. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar: their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence martyr, 10 August: the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star 1st magnitude of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star 2nd magnitude of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of presumably similar origin which had effectively or presumably appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings. THE VEILED SIBYL: Enthusiastically. THE VEILED SIBYL: Stabs herself. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. The very moment. The very reverend Canon O’Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. The vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall. The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer’s hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis. The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, distingué and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would. The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes. The violet silk petticoats. THE VIRAGO: Green above the red, says he. THE VIRAGO: Signs on you, hairy arse. The virgin at Hodges Figgis’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write. THE VIRGINS: Gushingly. The virgins Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms. The visible signs of antesatisfaction? The visible signs of postsatisfaction? The vocal muse. The voice, new warmth, speaking. THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED: Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth! THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED: Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rof, Aiulella! The voice of dark age, of unlove, earth’s fatigue made grave approach and painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men and true. THE VOICE OF FLORRY: Here. THE VOICE OF KITTY: In the thicket. The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. THE VOICE OF LYNCH: In the thicket. The voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous. The voice of the mournful chanter called to dolorous prayer. THE VOICE OF VIRAG: A birdchief, bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns. The voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered a lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footsteps there, told them the gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive. THE VOICE OF ZOE: From the thicket. The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields. The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not. The waggoner marching at their head saluted. The walk. The walls are tapestried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. —The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown’s awe. The wand in Lynch’s hand flashes: a brass poker. The warm impress of her warm form. The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured. THE WATCH: Bloom. THE WATCH: Saluting together. THE WATERFALL:
     Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca. THE WATERFALL:
     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
     Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca. THE WATERFALL:
     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca. The water rate, Mr Boylan. The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid’s bow, Greekly perfect. The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack. The way of all our old industries. The way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt. —The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. The way they spring those questions on you. The weapon used. THE WEARER OF THE CROWN
 Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished. The weather has been so warm. —The weather is changing, he said quietly. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes. The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of Mananaan. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s belly. THE WHORES:
 Are you going far, queer fellow? THE WHORES: Bravo! THE WHORES: Jammed in the doorway, pointing. THE WHORES: Laughing. The whores point. The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The widower. —The wife has a fine voice. —The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom. The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? —The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will’s widow, is the will to die. The wind! The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. The wise father knows his own child. The witching hour of night. The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out. The woman is inebriated. THE WOMEN: Little father! The women remained behind: thanksgiving. The women’s heads coalesce. The word known to all men. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire. The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth. The words troubled their gaze. The word Sums was written on the headline. The work of salvage, removal of débris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall’s light infantry under the general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B., M. P., J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. —The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could. The world is before you. The world is mine. THE WREATHS: Sweet are the sweets. They. —They accuse, remarked he audibly. They acted according to their lights. They advertised it. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore. They all fall to the ground. They always build one door opposite another for the wind to. They always know. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. They are coming, waves. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant fiat! light shall flood the world. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, his lordship the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Waterford, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor, His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue, archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander, archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vicechairmen of hotel syndicates. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze. They are lovely. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. They are not Boyl: no, M’Glade’s men. They are not even registered. They are not going to get me this innings. They are not in my dictionary. They are not to be thought away. They are out, tumultuously, off for a minute’s race, all bravely legging it, Burke’s of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. They are practical and are proved to be so. They are still. —They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities, hardly record its breach. They are waiting for him now. They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief. They believe in chance because like themselves. They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid. They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald. They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling. They buy the place up with gold and still they have all the gold. They buy up all the juicy ones. They call it reincarnation. They call them stupid. They came down the steps from Leahy’s terrace prudently, Frauenzimmer: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand. They can live on. They can’t manage men’s intervals. They can’t play it here. They caught up on the others and walked abreast. They challenged me to a sprint. They charge! They cheer. They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard. They clasped and sundered, did the coupler’s will. They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter’s. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls. They cook in soda. They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes. They could easily have big establishments whole thing quite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings and five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years want to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think. They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way. They covered their heads. They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw. They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall. They did right to put him up over a urinal: meeting of the waters. They die. They do. They don’t care. They don’t care what man looks. They don’t seem to chew it: only swallow it down. They drank cool stout. They drink in order to say or do something or cherchez la femme. —They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip. They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. The year returns. The year the missus was there... THE YEWS: Mingling their boughs. THE YEWS: Murmuring. THE YEWS: Rustling. THE YEWS: Ssh! THE YEWS: Ssh! THE YEWS: Sweeping downward. THE YEWS: Their leaves whispering. THE YEWS: Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms aging and swaying. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O’Brien against Daniel O’Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M’Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond, John O’Leary against Lear O’Johnny, Lord Edward Fitzgerald against Lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O’Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The O’Donoghue. They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. They feel all that. They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me. —They fit well enough, Stephen answered. They floated, fell: they faded. They followed. They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms. They followed the winding path down to the creek. They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram. They giggle. They give him a leg up. They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits. They go, they come. They grab at each other’s hair, claw at each other and spit. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coral and copper snow. They had a gay old time while it lasted. They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. They had no idea it was that high. They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak. They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale. They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:
—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. They hark him on. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them. They have no. They have no mercy on that here or infanticide. They have the dimensions of your other features, that’s all. They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes. They hide. They hold and pinion Bloom. They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer. They kick out grand. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. They know it all by heart. They laughed all three. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till. They lend ear. They lifted. They like buttering themselves in and out. They like it because no-one can hear. They like them sizeable. They list. They list. They listened. They looked. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed. They look terrible the women. They love reading about it. They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. They made ready to cross O’Connell street. They make him welcome. They make you kaputt, Leopoldleben. They mistrust what you tell them. They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun. They mock to try you. They move off with slow heavy tread. They murmur together. They must be starved. They never come back. They never expected that. They never forget an appointment. They nod vigorously in agreement. They offer to come over here. They ought to. They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. —They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf. They ought to invent something to stop that. The young are old. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour. The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig. The young man’s face grew dark. The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. The young May moon she’s beaming, love. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. 
—The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate. The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward. The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig. The youth who could not shiver and shake. They pass. They passed Dan Lowry’s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile. They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station. They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator’s form. They paused at the counter. They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven. They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by maraschino, thoughtful all two. They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain. They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings. —They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses. They’re a mixed breed. They’re gone round to the Oval for a drink. —They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all. They release him. They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. —They’re not European, says the citizen. They’re not straight men of business either. —They’re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said. They’re so particular. They’re taught that. They rose in dark and evil days. They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddy flecks, silvery sequins. They saluted him and were saluted. They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. —They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said. They say he never put on the city marshal’s uniform since he got the job. They say I killed you, mother. They say it’s healthier. They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight. —They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said, friendly and earnest. They say we have forgotten it. They say you can’t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head. They say you do when you shiver in the sun. They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines’ blue dome, Adam and Eve’s, saint Laurence O’Toole’s. They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves. They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife. They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. They sing. —They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. They sometimes feel what a person is. They split up in groups and scattered, saluting, towards their beats. They spread foot and mouth disease too. They stick by one another like glue. They stick to you when you’re down. They stopped. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats. They take advantage. They take me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage. They talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness. They talk excitedly. They tell me he’s round there in Dillon’s. —They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They thereupon stopped. They think it funny. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow. They turned to the left along Abbey street. They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. They understand what we say better than we understand them. They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance. They used to call him big Ben. They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. They wag their beards at Bloom. They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks. They walked on towards the gates. They want it. They want special dishes to pretend they’re. —They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar. They wash and tub and scrub. They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish. They went down Parliament street. —They went forth to battle, Mr O’Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell. They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen’s theatre: in silence. They went under. They went up the steps and under Merchants’ arch. They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown..... They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. They were gentlemen. They were haggling over money. —They were nature’s gentlemen, J. J. O’Molloy murmured. They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America. They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. They were there gathered together without distinction of social class and a most edifying spectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. They wheeled, flapping. They wheeled flapping weakly. They wheeled lower. They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging, they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away. They whisper again. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand jury. They wouldn’t care about the smell of it. —They wouldn’t give anything on them, she said. They wouldn’t play... Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings. Thieves rob the slain. Thigh smack. Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning. Thine heart, mine love. Thing done. Thing is if you really believe in it. Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her. Things go on same, day after day: squads of police marching out, back: trams in, out. Think he’s that way inclined a bit. Thinking of Spain. Thinking strictly prohibited. Think in my stom. Think no more about that. Think over it. Thinks he’ll cure it with pills. Thinks he’ll win in Answers, poets’ picture puzzle. Thinks I’m a tree, so blind. Think that pugnosed driver did it out of spite. Think what it means. Think you’re escaping and run into yourself. Think you’re the only pebble on the beach? Third hint. Third time. Third time is the charm. Thirsty fox. Thirtytwo feet per second per second. Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Thirtytwo workmen, wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder, construct the new Bloomusalem. This. This. This. This ad, you see. This black makes me sad. This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. This bung’s about burst. This cemetery is a treacherous place. This dogsbody to rid of vermin. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. This feast of pure reason. —This for me? he asked gallantly. —This gentleman? This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage. This is a lonehand fight. This is for shillings. This is for sovereigns. This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. This is my body. This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. This isn’t a brothel. This isn’t a musical peepshow. —This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. This is the age of patent medicines. This is the appearance is on me. This is the flower in question. This is the jingle that joggled and jingled. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. This is the postcreation. —This is the riddle, Stephen said:
     The cock crew,
     The sky was blue:
     The bells in heaven
     Were striking eleven. This is the very worst hour of the day. This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast. —This morning Hynes put it in of course the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue, Sandymount, for interment in Glasnevin. This morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread or wine in Omar. This moving kidney. This owner, that. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. This poor hardworking man! This position. This searching ordeal. This silken purse I made out of the sow’s ear of the public. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell’s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous. This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley. This verily is that. This very church. This very instant. This very moment. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did. This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her. This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die. This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. This way... —This way, he said, walking to the right. This weather makes you dull. This wet is very unpleasant. This will end. This wind is sweeter. This would be tantamount to a cooperation one of nature’s favourite devices between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, succubitus felix, of the passive element. Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H. Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson, C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes. Thom’s Dublin Post Office Directory, 1886. Thos. —Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him. Those are names. —Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs. Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente, not doing a hand’s turn all day. Those crawthumpers, now that’s a good name for them, there’s always something shiftylooking about them. Those farmers are always grumbling. Those girls, those girls,
     Those lovely seaside girls. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Those girls, those lovely. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk. Those literary etherial people they are all. Those lovely curtains. Those lovely seaside girls. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands. Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Those poor birds. Those pretty little seaside gurls. Those races are on today. THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES
—Easy all, Myles Crawford said. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Those that hides knows where to find. Those today. Those two loonies mooching about. Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain. Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not D.V. been brought. Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony. —Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live. Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. Thou art all their daddies, Theodore. Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest progenitor barring none in this chaffering allincluding most farraginous chronicle. Thou art Peter. Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain. Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm. Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly. —Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear. Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in Maritana on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat having detected a discrepancy between his name assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s bona fides nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest. Though our ages. Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive. Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles. Though that halfbaked Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left. Thought he had a deposit of lead in his penis. Thought he was asleep first. Though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought. Though they stink yet they sting. Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence. Thought is the thought of thought. Thoughts from Spinoza maroon leather. Thought so. Thought so. Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment’s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted. Thou’ll no be telling me thot, Pold veg! Thou lost one. —Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford. Thousand lives lost. Thousand places of entertainment to expense your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps hers heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous. Thousands every hour. Thou sawest thy America, thy lifetask, and didst charge to cover like the transpontine bison. Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Thr... Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. Three. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Three and a half. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form the cheek of her! because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself. Three and nine? Three and six I gave for the frame. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street. Three bob I lent him in Meagher’s. —Three cheers for De Wet! Three cheers for Ikey Mo! Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth. Three days. Three days! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a vinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy’s ducats. Three half ones, Terry. Three holes, all women. Three hundred kicked the bucket. Three Hynes owes me. Three months’ renewal. —Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand. Three newlaid gallons a day. Three nooses round me here. —Threepence, please. —Three pints, Terry, says Joe. Three pounds, thirteen and six. Three pounds three. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Three Purty Maids from School. Three score and ten, sir. Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of More Nebukim Guide of the Perplexed and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses of Egypt to Moses Mendelssohn there arose none like Moses Maimonides. —Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily. Three times now. Three times ten. —Three twelve, he said. Three weeks. Three we have. Three years old she was in front of Molly’s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours. Thrilled she listened, bending in sympathy to hear. Thrill now. Throb always without you and the throb always within. Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect. Throstle fluted. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti’s reading closet. Through here. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls roteatingly from the Lion’s Head cliff into the purple waiting waters. Through spaces smaller than red globules of man’s blood they creepycrawl after Blake’s buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow. Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling. Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered lives. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. Through yerd our lord, Amen. Throwaway. Throwaway, says he. —Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. Throw flower at his feet. —Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. Throwing them up in the air to catch them. Throw it there. Throw them the bone. Thrust syphilis down to hell and with him those other licensed spirits. Thumbed pages: read and read. Thump. Thumping. Thumping. Thumping. Thump, thump, thump. Thunderation! Thunder in the air. Thunderstorm. Thursday. Thursday. Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley’s. Thursday, of course. Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say:
—They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible. Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden. Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage. Thus spake Zarathustra. Thy cow’s dug was tough, what? Thy will be done. Ticking. —Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty’s truth was known. Ticktacktwo wouldyousetashoe? Tide comes here. Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, oinopa ponton, a winedark sea. Tide you over. Tie a knot on your shift. Tiens, quel petit pied! Tiens, tiens, but it is well sad, that, my faith, yes. Tight. Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. Tight boots? Tight collar he’ll lose his hair. Tight, dear. Tight trou. Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon. Till the next time. Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen. Time all. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Time enough. Time enough. —Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. Time enough yet. Time ever passing. Time, gents! Time going on. Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted. Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing. Time makes the tune. Time of the plague. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock. Time’s livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry. Times of the troubles. Time someone thought about it instead of gassing about the what was it the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence. Time surely would scatter all. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. Time to be shoving. Time to get a bath round the corner. Time to get out. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. Time will be gone then. Time will come. Timing her. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. Timothy of the battered naggin. Tinge of purple. Tink cried to bronze in pity. Tinkling. Tink to her pity cried a diner’s bell. Tiny, her tremulous fernfoils of maidenhair. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands. Tip. Tip. Tip. Tipping her tepping her tapping her topping her. Tips, evening dress, halfnaked ladies. —Tiptop... —Tiptop. Tiptop position for a pub. Tiptop, thanks. Tired I feel now. Tired seemingly, he ceased. Tiresome kind of a job. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. —’Tis all that. ’Tis a merry rogue. ’Tis as cheap sitting as standing. ’Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king’s bible. ’Tis, sure. ’Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry. ’Tis the last rose of summer dollard left bloom felt wind wound round inside. ’Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. ’Tis time for her poor soul
     To get out of heaven. ’Tis time for this poor soul
     To go to heaven. —T is viceregal lodge. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. To. To aid gentleman in literary. To aid gentleman in literary work.

To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever. To attempt my virtue! To attendance on your wife. To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge. Tobaccoshopgirls. To be a shoefitter in Manfield’s was my love’s young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. To be or not to be. To be or not to be. To be printed and bound at the Druiddrum press by two designing females. To be seen and heard. To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. To be sure. —To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders. —To be sure, poor fellow. To Bloom. To Bloom. To Bloom. To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity. To breathe. To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s. To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams. —To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. To Cissy Caffrey. To come to the point at issue. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. To conclude, while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being. To curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat, having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party. To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans, he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship terminated by the premature emigration of the former he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of colonial e.g. To dare address me! Today. Today. Today. Today. Today it is. Today the bards must drink and junket. To enter or not to enter. To evening lands. —... to Flora’s lips did hie. To, fro. Together she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny, together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.

To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile. To her, old patriarch! To himself. Toil on, labour like a very bandog and let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove as he fully intended doing at the rate of one guinea per column. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers if both speakers were resident in the same place, the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street W. and E. Connery, proprietors, the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences if both speakers were resident in different places. To keep it up. To keep it up. To keep it up. To keep it up. To knock or not to knock. To lap better, all porous holes. Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa’s. Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus, he’d kick the shite out of him. To learn French? To learn one must be humble. To look younger. To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes. Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and large scarlet asters in their buttonholes, leap out. TOM AND SAM:

To Master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief in the tenets of the Irish protestant church to which his father Rudolf Virag later Rudolph Bloom had been converted from the Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity among the jews subsequently abjured by him in favour of Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888. —To me! To me. To me it’s all a mockery and beastly. To me, to him, to her, you too, me, us. To mind her stops. Tom Kernan strutted in. —Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. TOM KERNAN: You deserve it, your honour. Tommy! Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. Tommy on the clay! Tommy on the clay here! Tomorrow is killing day. Tomorrow will be a week that I received... it is no use Leopold to be

TOM ROCHFORD: A hand to his breastbone, bows. Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat. Tom Rochford nodded and drank. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his twocolumned machine. Tom Rochford said. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him. 
 Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat. Tom Rochford, winner, in athlete’s singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. Tonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts. Tongue when she talks like the clapper of a bellows. Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. Tonight perhaps. To no end gathered; vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Too bad! Too dear too near to home sweet home. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly. Too full for words. Too full for words. Too heady. Too hot to quarrel. Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure. Took off her hat to show her hair. Too late. Too late. Too late box. Too late for Leah, Lily of Killarney. Too late now. Too many drugs spoil the broth. Too many in the world. Too much bone in their skulls. Too much fat on the parsnips. Too much for me now. Too much John Barleycorn. Too much mystery business in it. Too much of this. Too much trouble, first gentleman said. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing. Too poetical that about the sad. —Tooraloo, Lenehan said. Too showy. Too slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare. Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen. Toothless Kinch, the superman. Too tight? Tootling. Too ugly. To ourselves... new paganism... omphalos. Top and lashers going out. To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday proper and Friday normal on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess. To pour o’er sluices pouring gushes. Topping! To protect him as long as possible even in the earth. To provoke the rain. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess. To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity. To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him. To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. Torn envelope. Torn strip of envelope. Torry and Alexander last year. —To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer. To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour. To shave himself. To show the understudy in the title rôle how to. To show you how he hit the paper. To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. Toss off a glass of brandy neat while you’d say knife. To Stephen. To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised 1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails. To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip. To the court. To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. To the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding seahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor, might hear. To the High Sheriff of Dublin,
            Dublin. To the inexpressible grief of his. To the old dingdong again. To the right. To the second watch gaily. —To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey. To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age. To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy a habit of mind which he never did hold with to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. Touch. Touch and examine shis points. Touch and go with him. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Touches the spot? Touch him for a quid, will you? Touch lightly with two index fingers. Touch me. Touch me not. Touch, touch me. Touch water. Tourists over for the show. Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man. Tour the south then. To us! Tout le monde en avant! Tout le monde en place! Towards Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:
—For England... To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington’s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for, in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller. Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills. To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer? To where? To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why. To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view. To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation, saying straight off:
—To sweep the floor in the morning. To which particular boosing shed...? —To whom? To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will. To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. To wipe away a tear for martyrs that want to, dying to, die. Towncrier, bumbailiff. Town traveller. To write today. To yoke me as his yokefellow, our crimes our common cause. To Zoe. To Zoe. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. Trade follows the flag. Trails off there sad in minor. Trained by kindness. Trained by owner. Trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. Train with engine behind. Traitors swing. Tram kran kran kran. Trample the trampellers. Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are attitudes! parching. Trams: a car of Prescott’s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds. Trams passed one another, ingoing, outgoing, clanging.

Trousers tight as a drum on him. Troy measure. True. True as you’re there. —True for you, Nosey Flynn said. —True for you, says Joe. True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. True in the larger analysis. True men. —True men like you men. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward. True word spoken in jest. Truffles! Trumpery insanity. Trumplee. Trust? Trust me. Try. Try a bit.

Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets. Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words. Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway:
—Good day, Mr O’Rourke. Turning the curve he waved his hand. Turnkey’s daughter got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk. Turn Now On. Turn Now On. —Turn over, Stephen said quietly. Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Turn up like a bad penny. Turn up with a veil and black bag. TUTTI: Encore! Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller I have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in a circle of the best wits of the town, is my authority that in Cape Horn, ventre biche, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.

Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. Twenty to one. —Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures. Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. Twenty years of it, regret them not. Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent Milly at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression. Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up. Twice nought makes one. Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Twig? Twilight. Twilight. Twilight. Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. Twilight sleep idea: queen Victoria was given that. Twining, receding, with interchanging hands the night hours link each each with arching arms in a mosaic of movements. Twittering. Twittering. Twittering the bat flew here, flew there. ’Twixt me and you Caddareesh. Two. Two. Two. Two! Two. Two about here. Two and nine. Two and nine, sir. Two and six. Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers. —Two apples a penny! Two Ardilauns. Two bar. Two bar and a wing. Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths. Two bar entrance, soldiers half price. Two bridegrooms laughing heartily at each other. Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests. Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet’s. —Two, Corny Kelleher said. Two crossed keys here. Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling. Two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband’s brother. Two discs on the columns wobble, eyes of nought. —Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane. Two eleven. Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg. Two for a penny! Two, four, six, eight, nine. —Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away. Two houses they have. Two in the back bench whispered. Two is company. Two kindling faces watched her bend. Two left. Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman. —Two mélanges, Buck Mulligan said. Two multiplied by two divided by half is twice one. Two notes in one there. Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar. Two old trickies, what? Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife’s bag in which eleven cockles rolled. Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter. —Twopence each, the huckster said. —Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say. Two pieces of silver he lent me. 
 Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch. Two quills project over his ears. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning. Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely’s wise Bloom in Daly’s Henry Flower bought. Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly. —Two stouts here. Two strings to her bow. Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm. Two, three, Mars, that’s courage. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin. Typist going up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her understandings. Ubi patria, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in Alma Mater, vita bene. Uff! Ugh, that rat’s tail wriggling! Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail’s bed. Ugly: no woman thinks she is. Ulster king at arms! Umpteen millions. Uncertain in his movements. Uncertainly he waited. Unclaimed money too. Unclean job. Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight. —Uncle Richie, really... Uncle Toby’s page for tiny tots. Un coche ensablé Louis Veuillot called Gautier’s prose. Und alle Schiffe brücken. Un demi sétier! Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears, bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward’s staff, the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in shadow Dolores shedolores. Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction. Underconstumble? Undercutting. Underfed she looks too. Underground communication. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun. Underline imposs. Undermines the constitution. Understand animals too that way. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha. Under the mistletoe. Under the obituary notices they stuck it. Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew. Under the sandwichbell lay on a bier of bread one last, one lonely, last sardine of summer. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Under Tom Kernan’s ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow. Under what guidance, following what signs? Uneatable fox. Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted. Unfortunate creature! Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the latter portion. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Ungenitive. Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate. Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting from his jaws. Uniform. Uniform that does it. Uninvited. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Universal love. Universally that person’s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind’s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature’s incorrupted benefaction.

Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante’s Huguenots, Meyerbeer’s Seven Last Words on the Cross and Mozart’s Twelfth Mass he simply revelled in, the Gloria in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.

Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle? Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed no June has no ar no oysters. Was he short taken? Was he there when the father? Washing child, washing corpse. Washing her teeth. Wash off his sins of the world. Was it a celestial phenomenon? Was it a daisy? Was it goodbye?

Waste of money. Waste of time. Was that just when he, she? Was that not Mrs M’Guinness? Was that so? Was that then real? Was the clown Bloom’s son? Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality? Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical? Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications? Was then she him you us since knew? Was the proposal of asylum accepted? Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative? Was the young master saying anything? Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom? Wasting time explaining it to Flynn’s mouth. Was vast wealth acquirable through industrial channels?

Weak joy opened his lips. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker. Weak wasting hand on mine. We all do. Wealth of the world. We are a generous people but we must also be just. We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. We are all Irish, all kings’ sons. We are all looking forward anxiously. —We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. We are becoming important, it seems. We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university. We are engaged you see, sergeant. We are getting mixed. —We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said. We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic. We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an imperium, that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami. We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we. We are nae fou. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We are observed. We are praying now for the repose of his soul. We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary’s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534. We are stonecold and pure. We are the boys. We are the fat. We are their harps. We are the last. We are the last. Wear out my welcome. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Weary? Weary they curchycurchy under veils. Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters. Weathercocks. Weave, weaver of the wind. We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome. We brought them in. We call it black. —We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O’Madden Burke said. —We can do that, he said. —We can do that, the foreman said. —We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. We can see from farther up. We can’t wait. We charge! We come to bury Cæsar. Weda seca whokilla farst. We did great biz yesterday. We didn’t hear. We don’t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities. We don’t want any scandal, you understand. We drive them headlong! We eat electric light. We enjoyed ourselves immensely. Weeny bones. Weeping willow. —Weep no more, Comyn said. Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin. We fall. We feel in England. We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. We gave him that idea, he added to J. J. O’Molloy. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. We gave shade on languorous summer days. We give it up. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the morning after the night before. —We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said. We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we? We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway. We had to. We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh’s gave us the number. We hand you crisp five pound note. —We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly. We have certainly... We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. We have committed many errors and many sins. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast. We have him. We have King Lear: and it is immortal. We have met. We have met before. We have nothing in the house but backache pills. We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. We have our meeting. We have so much correspondence. We have time. We heard the piano. We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next. Weighs on his mind. Weightcarrying huntress. Weight for age. Weight off their mind. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. —We know him, says the citizen. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. We know that in the castle. —We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. We know what put English gold in his pocket. Welcome as the flowers in May. We learned that from them. We let them come in. Well? —Well? Well? Well? —Well. Well? Well... Well... Well. Well? Well and what’s cheese? Well, aren’t they? —We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. We’ll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you’ll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, whatever the buggers’ names were, suffocated in the one cesspool. Well but that fellow would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention? Well, by the living God, you’ll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. Well cocks and lions do the same and stags. Wellcut frockcoat. Well, doc? Well done, thou good and faithful servant! Well educated. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. —Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said. —Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Well, God is good, sir. —Well, good health, Jack, says Ned. —We’ll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree. Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. We’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. —Well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight. —Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Well, I am here now. Well, if he couldn’t remember the dayfather’s name that he sees every day. Well: if the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be a son? Well, I have. Well, I’ll shove along. —Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. Well, I must be. —Well, in that case, he said, I don’t see why you should expect payment for it since you don’t believe it yourself. Well, it is a long rest. —Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse. Well, it’s a sea. Well it’s God’s acre for them. Well, it’s like a company idea, you see. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. Well, it was in the papers about Antichrist. —Well, J. J. O’Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example. —Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. —Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said. Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. Wellmannered fellow. We’ll manure you, Mr Flower! Wellmeaning old man. Well, meet him. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. —Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it’s worth a short par. Well, my fault perhaps. We’ll never meet again. —Well no, Mr Bloom said. Well, now! —Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. —Well now I am, he mused. Well now, look at that. Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. Well of all the. Well, of course, if we knew all the things. Well, of course that’s what gives him the base barreltone. Well, of course, where there’s money going there’s always someone to pick it up. Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy. Well out of that ruck I am. —We’ll owe twopence, he said. We’ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence. Well, perhaps it was best for him. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden. We’ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot’s ear this time. —We’ll put force against force, says the citizen. Wellread fellow. —Well, says J. J., if they’re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. —Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now. —Well, says John Wyse. —Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. —Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action? —We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish. —Well, sir, he began. Well, sir, the husband took him by the throat. Well: slainte! Well, so it is. Well, so long. Well sung. —Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers. Well the foreskin is not back. Well then Friday buried him. Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. —Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted. —Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power. Well, the voice, yes: gramophone. —Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. Well tinned in there. Well, tolloll. Wellturned foot. Well up: it splashed yellow near his boot. Well, well. Well, well. Well, well. Well, what are you gaping at? —Well, what is it? he said, stopping. —Well, what’ll it be? Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention. Welsh, were they not? Welts of flesh behind on him. Welt them through life, then wallop after death. We medical men. We must be quick. We must go to Athens. We mustn’t be led away by words, by sounds of words. We must take a charitable view of it. We never speak as we pass by. Went out in a puff. Went too far last time. We obey them in the grave. We ought to have hats modelled on our heads. We’re all in a cart. —We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. We’re going. We’re in the archdiocese here. We’re nae tha fou. We’re nae tha fou. —We’re off again. We’re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me. Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned? We’re safe. We’re square. —We’re stopped. Were their views on some points divergent? Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun? Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable? Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast? Were there schemes of wider scope? Were there testimonials? We’re the same. Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten? Were they indefinitely inactive? Were those nightclouds there all the time? Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims? Were you in a funk? Were you in the Scotch house now? —Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I. —Were you round at the court? says Joe. Werf those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy! WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK
 Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti’s desk. We serve them. —We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. We should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. We started singing glees and duets: Lo, the early beam of morning. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. Wet bright bills for next week. We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors. Wetherup always said that. We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative. —We thought you were someone else. Wet night in the lane. We two. We two, she said, will seek the kips where shady Mary is. We two the last. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. We want no more strangers in our house. —We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best’s approval. We was chased by pirates one voyage. We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers’ hall. We were in Lombard street west. We were never loyal to the successful. We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. We were very pleased, we others. We were weak, therefore worthless. We won every time! Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. Wha gev ye thon colt? Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. Wha’ll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row? —What? —What? —What? What? —What? —What? What? —What? What? What? —What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?... What? What? What? What?... What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What... What? What? What? What? What? What about? —What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. What about English wateringplaces? What about going out there: Ballsbridge. —What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? —What about that? What about that, eh? —What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder. What about that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his newspaper. What about what? What a brute he had been! What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination? What additional attractions might the grounds contain? What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress? What advance on two bob, gentlemen? What advantages attended shaving by night? What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied bed? —What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage. What a great notion they had! What ails it tonight? What a lark. What a lark! What a learned speech, eh? What also stimulated him in his cogitations? What am I following him for? What am I saying barrels? What among other data did the second volume of the work in question contain? What anagrams had he made on his name in youth? WHAT?—AND LIKEWISE—WHERE?
—But what do you call it? What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature? What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreducible consummation? What a persuasive power that girl had! What a pity! What a pity the government did not supply our men with wonderworkers during the South African campaign! What a relief it would have been! —What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled. What are they? —What are you doing? —What are you doing here, Stephen? —What are you doing round those parts? says Joe. What are you hiding behind your back? What are you saying about my king? —What are you singing? What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the Freeman leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland. —What? asked Besteglinton. What a stupid ad! —What a time you were! she said. What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser? What becomes of it after? —What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension. What bogeyman’s trick is this? What, boys? What caused him consolation in his sitting posture? What caused him irritation in his sitting posture? What causes that? What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed? What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act? What comforted his misapprehension?

What did you say that for? What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other? —What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked. What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive? What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased? What does he do? What does it care about offences? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it? What does she say? What does that mean? What does that teco mean? What do I here behold? What do they be thinking about? What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? What do they love? What do they say was the cause? What do they think when they hear music? What do we care for his wife or father? What do ye lack? What do you expect her to do? What do you lack with your barbed wire? What do you mean? —What do you mean? What do you think, Martin? What do you think of that, citizen? What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A. E. the mastermystic? What do you want for ninepence? What dreams would he have, not seeing? What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard? What, eh, do you follow me? What, eleven? What else were they invented for? What endemic characteristics were present? What eventuality would render him independent of such wealth? Whatever do you think of me? Whatever in that one case done commodiously done was. —Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you. What exchange of money took place between host and guest? What facilities of transit were desirable? —What few days? he boomed. What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror? What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom deceased? What followed this operation? What followed this silent action? What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself. What fractions of phrases did the lecture of those five whole words evoke? What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest? What frightens them, light or noise? What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars? What Garry? What had been his hypothetical singular solutions? What had Gretta Conroy on? What had prevented him from completing a topical song music by R. G. Johnston on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition 30 January 1893 of the grand annual Christmas pantomime Sinbad the Sailor produced by R.

What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia? What if that nightmare gave you a back kick? What I mean is... What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?

     But we had spared... When? When? When? When? When? When all agog miss Douce said eagerly:
—Look at the fellow in the tall silk. When all is said Dumas fils or is it Dumas père? is right. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources by supposition surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king. When citybound frequent connection by train or tram from their respective intermediate station or terminal. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. When countrybound velocipedes, a chainless freewheel roadster cycle with side basketcar attached, or draught conveyance, a donkey with wicker trap or smart phaeton with good working solidungular cob roan gelding, 14 h. When first he saw. When first he saw that form endearing? When first I saw... —When first I saw that form endearing... When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn’t expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word. When for Irelandear. When he had betaken himself to the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. When in doubt persecute Bloom. When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes. When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm. When is it? —When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe. When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. When love absorbs. When love absorbs my ardent soul. When my country takes her place among. When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then, let my epitaph be written. When night hides her body’s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired. When one reads these strange pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who once... When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote Hamlet he was not the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection. When she had gone he said, laughing:
—We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. When she lays her egg she is so glad. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue. When the angel’s book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. When, then? When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:
—What is this he is? —When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings. When three it’s night. When was it I got it made up last? When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. When we left Lombard street west something changed. When We Were Boys by William O’Brien M. P. green cloth, slightly faded, envelope bookmark at p. When we were hard up I washed them to save the laundry bill. When will I hear the joke? When will we meet? When you come out without your gun. When you feel like that you often meet what you feel. When you have lived as long as I have. When you hold out the fork. When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement. When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood. When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne. When you two begin... Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Where are the other two gone? Where are they? Where are those blasted keys? —Where are we? Where are we? Where are we going? Where are you from? Where are you now? Where are you off to? Where are your wits? Whereas. Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a wellknown dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold and a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable... Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word. Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s smiles. Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: Mr Malachi Mulligan. Where bronze from anear? Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush. Where did I? Where did I? Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath? Where did I put the letter? Where did they get the plums? —Where did you get it? Where did you launch it from? —Where did you try? Where does he hang out? Where does he live at present? Where do they get that? Where do they get the money? —Where do you begin in this? —Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o’er the waters dull. Where eat? Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows. Where? gold asked more eagerly. Where gold from afar? Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him? Where has he disappeared to? Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O’Hagan. Where hoofs? Where I come in. Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth. Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was. —Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Where is he now? Where is he now? —Where is he? says Lenehan. Where is his guncase? Where is it? Where is my hat, by the way? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions? Where is she? Where is that child’s funeral disappeared to? Where is that Parsee tower of silence? —Where is that? the professor asked. Where is the justice being born that way? Where is the spirituality? Where is this? Where is your brother? Where it took place. Where now? Where off to? Where old Mrs Riordan died. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the Queen’s. —Where? says Alf. Where’s Dilly? Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Where’s Monks? Where’s my augur’s rod? Where’s my hat? Where’s my hat. Where’s my pipe, by the way? Where’s old Tweedy’s regiment? Where’s Punch? Where’s that bleeding awfur? Where’s that Goddamned cursed ashtray? Where’s the archbishop’s letter? Where’s the bloody house? Where’s the buck and Namby Amby? Where’s the red carpet spread? Where’s the sugar? Where’s the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Where’s the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Where’s what’s his name? Where’s your configuration? Where’s your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Where the bugger is it? Where the deuce did he pop out of? Where the foreleg of King Billy’s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. Where the Henry Nevil’s sawbones and ole clo? Where then? —Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering. Whereto? Wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s vital strength. Where was Moses when the candle went out? Where was that? Where was that ad some Birmingham firm the luminous crucifix. —Where was that, Myles? Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere? Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber. Where we. Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north? Where were they now? —Where would I get money? Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work. Where you slep las nigh? Whether on the scaffold high. Whether on the scaffold high. Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. Whetstone! Whew! Whew! Whew! Which? Which. —Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom. Which auction rooms?... Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind? Which end is his head? Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration? Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success? Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons. Which is which? —Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth? Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul? Which preferably? Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest? Which side is your knowledge bump? Which side will she get up? —Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered? Which volume was the largest in bulk? Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:
—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed. —Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it. While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he smoked, who smoked. While Goulding talked of Barraclough’s voice production, while Tom Kernan, harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him. While he waited in Temple bar M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise. While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on jerkily. While the kettle is boiling. While the other was reading it on page two Boom to give him for the nonce his new misnomer whiled away a few odd leisure moments in fits and starts with the account of the third event at Ascot on page three, his side. While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. While you wait if you wait he will wait while you wait. Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position. Whisky and water on the brain. Whisper. Whisper. Whisper. Whisper. Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Whispering around you. Whispering gallery walls have ears. Whispering lovewords murmur, liplapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop. Whisper, who the sooty hell’s the johnny in the black duds? Whistle brings rain they say. Whistles call and answer. White. White breast of the dim sea. Whitehatted chef like a rabbi. White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping. Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his. White missionary too salty. White slip of paper. White thy fambles, red thy gan
     And thy quarrons dainty is. White thy fambles, red thy gan
     And thy quarrons dainty is. White yoghin of the gods. Whither away? Who? —Who? —Who? Who? —Who? Who? Who? Whoa! Whoa, my jewel! Who are. —Who are the letters for? —Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. —Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Who ate or something the somethings of the reverend Mr MacTrigger. Who ate them? Who booed Joe Chamberlain? Who brought me into this world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. Who came to Poulaphouca with the High School excursion? —Who can answer a riddle? Who can say? Who chose this face for me? Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may guess. Who comes through Michan’s land, bedight in sable armour? Who could count them? Who could know the truth? Who departed this life. Who did you learn that from? Who distilled first? Who drank more quickly? Who... drive... Who ever anywhere will read these written words? Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned. Who fears to speak of nineteen four? Who found them out? Who gave it to you? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Who had the? —Who has not? Who has passed here before me? Who has the most matches? Who has the organ here I wonder? Who has twopence? Who have you now like John Philpot Curran? Who helps to believe? —Who is he if it’s a fair question? Who is it? —Who is Junius? says J. J.
—We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian. Who is King Hamlet? Who is my neighbour? —Who is that? Who is that beside them? —Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or he any son? Who is the ghost from limbo patrum, returning to the world that has forgotten him? —Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe. Who is this she was like? Who is this was telling me? Who is this wrote? Who kicked the bucket. Who knows? Who knows? —Who knows? he said. Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps? Who knows what they’re always flying for. Whole earnest. Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade? Whole place gone to hell. Whole route, see? Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Who lives there? Who’ll dance? Who’ll hang Judas Iscariot? Who’ll read the book? —Who made those allegations? says Alf. —Who may he be? —Who may he be? he asked. —Whom do you suspect? he challenged. Whom were you trying to walk like? Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy. Whooping cough they say it cures. Who owns the bleeding tyke? Who passed away. Who profaned our silent shade? Whores in Turkish graveyards. Whores screech. Whorusalaminyourhighhohhhh... Who said four? Who’s astanding this here do? —Who? says Bloom. —Who? says I. —Who? says I. —Who? says I. —Who? says Joe. Who’s behind me? —Who’s dead? says Bob Doran. Who’s dead, when and what did he die of? Who’s dear Gerald? —Whose admirers? says Joe. —Whose God? says the citizen. Whose mother is beastly dead. Whose smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Who’s getting it up? Who’s getting it up? Who’s he when he’s at home? Who’s hindering you? Who’s in the corner? Who’s in the... peepofgold? Who’s making love to my sweeties? Who’s moth moth? Who’s paying here? Who’s riding her? —Who’s standing? Who’s talking about...? —Who’s that? Who’s that with you? —Who’s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated. Who’s the old ballocks you were talking to? Who’s there?... Who’s to pay for that? Who supposes it? Who taught you palmistry? Who the deuce scrawled all over those walls with matches? —Who? the editor asked. Who the girls in The Tempest, in Pericles, in Winter’s Tale are we know. —Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said. —Who? the professor said, turning. Who to clear it? Who tore it? Who to unbelieve? —Who tried the case? says Joe. Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe and here he fetched a deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Who wander through the world. —Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Who wants your opinion? Who was he? Who was it told me his name? Who was M’Intosh? Who was telling me? Who was telling me? —Who was the letter from? he asked. Who watches me here? Who will we do it on? Who will woo you? —Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry. Who writes? Who wrote this? Whrrwhee! W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Whusky! W. H.: who am I? Why? Why? Why? Why? —Why? Why? Why? —Why? Why? Why? —Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? —Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading. Why are their tongues so rough? Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside? Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity? Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise? Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse? Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life? Why did he come? Why did he desist from speculation? Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result? Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace? Why did he take them rather than others? Why did I? Why did I run? Why did I smell it only now? Why didn’t you kiss the spot to make it well? Why didn’t you tell me before. Why did she me? Why did you enclose the stamps? Why did you write it then? Why does he send to one who is a buonaroba, a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? Why do I always think Figather? —Why don’t you grow? asked Blazes Boylan. Why don’t you play them as I do? Why don’t you trust me more? Why do they call that thing they gave me nutsteak? Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? Why do you call me naught? Why do you not write your poetry in that language? Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question? Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability? —Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw. Why had they chosen all that part? Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously? Why have women such eyes of witchery? Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding which he had not done. Why he fixed on me. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Why I bought her the violet garters. Why I left the church of Rome? Why I left the church of Rome. Why in? Why is that? Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps? Why is the underplot of King Lear in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney’s Arcadia and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history? Why, I wonder. Why, look at our public life! Why, look at the man’s private life! Why me? Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s daughter? Why minor sad? Why Molly likes opoponax. Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity? Why mutable aliorelative? Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke? Why not endless till the farthest star? —Why not? says J. J., when he’s quite sure which country it is. Why Ophelia committed suicide. Why pay more? Why she waved her hand. Why should I bring it down? Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? Why similarly, why differently? —Why, sir? Why solitary ipsorelative? Why that highclass whore in Jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose. Why the barber in Drago’s always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Why the cannibals cotton to it. —Why then not much, Father Cowley said. —Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on. —Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny? —Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. —Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. Why they call him Doughy Daw. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés. Why think of them? Why this infliction? Why those plainclothes men are always courting slaveys. Why was he doubly irritated? Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich? Why was the host reluctant, unresisting still? Why was the host secret infidel silent? Why was the host victim predestined sad? Why we left the church of Rome. Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say. —Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language? Why with satisfaction? Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him? Why, you’re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! Wide brim. Widower I hate to see. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. —Widow woman, says Ned. Wife a good cook and washer. Wife and six children at home. Wife in every port they say. Wife in her throes. Wife ironing his back. Wife is oldish. Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. —Wife well? —Wife well, I suppose? Wild excitement. Wild geese. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman’s breasts full in her blouse of nun’s veiling, fat nipples upright. Wild sea money. Will? Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother? Will eat anything. Will happen too. Will happen, yes. —Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image? Will I? William ✠. WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH: In purple stock and shovel hat. WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT
 Red Murray touched Mr Bloom’s arm with the shears and whispered:
—Brayden. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. 
 William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge. William Shakespeare and company, limited. Will I get up? Will I give him a lift home? Will immensely splendiferous stander permit one stooder of most extreme poverty and one largesize grandacious thirst to terminate one expensive inaugurated libation? Will I tell him that horse Lenehan? —Will lift your glass with us. Will lift your tschink with tschunk. Will o’ the wisp. Will send when developed. Will she? Will she come here tomorrow? Will someone tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty? Will we be there by candlelight? Will write fully tomorrow. Will you be as gods? Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid? Will you ever forget his goggle eye? —Will you join us, Myles? Will you please?... Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging? —Will you try another, citizen? says Joe. —Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here. —Will you write the address, sir? Willy’s hat and what the girls did with it. Wimple suited her small head. Windandwatery though. Windfall when he kicks out. Winding of his ticker. Windows open. 29 Windsor avenue. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin’s concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house. Wine. Wine. Wine in my face. —Wine of the country, says he. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. Wine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish cheese. Winkle: cockles and periwinkles. Winner trained by Braime so that Lenehan’s version of the business was all pure buncombe. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Wiped his nose in curtain too. Wiping pens in their stockings. Wire in yet? Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message. Wisdom while you wait. Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Wise men say. —Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said. Wish I could. Wish I could see his face, though. Wish I had a full length oilpainting of her then. Wish I hadn’t met that M’Coy fellow. Wish I hadn’t promised to meet. Wish she hadn’t called me sir. Wish they’d sing more. Wispish hair over her ears. Wit. With? With a belly on him like a poisoned pup. With a bewitching smile. —With a broken back, is it? With a cock with a carra. With a cock with a carra. With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. With a cry of stormbirds. With a deft kick he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. With a dry snigger. With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears. With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable. With a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here middle of the day of Bob Doran’s bottle shoulders. With all his belongings on show. With all his faults she loved him still when he sang Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee or My love and cottage near Rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang The moon hath raised with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward. With an accent on the whose. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack. With a nervous twitch of his head. With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet: then lies, shamming dead, with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master. With a railway bloke. With a saffron kilt? With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. With a tear in his eye. With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. With a voice of whistling seawind. With a wand he beats time slowly. With awe Mr Power’s blank voice spoke:
—Some say he is not in that grave at all. With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed omophorion, with clotted hinderparts. With bows a traitor servant. With brains, sir. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone. With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode his own or not his own: with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death. With clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho hornblower blue green yellow flashes Toft’s cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again. With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door. —With Dignam, says Alf. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. With faraway mourning mountain eye. With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom. With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly. With gibbering baboon’s cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm. With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane’s she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg. With Hamilton Long’s syringe, the ladies’ friend. With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands. With him together down... With him would he speak a word. With his bit of beard! With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:
—God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. With his name in Stubbs’s. With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch’s bastard. With how many? With hungered flesh obscurely, he mutely craved to adore. With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion. Within womb won he worship. With it an abode of bliss. With it an abode of bliss. With it an abode of bliss. —With it, Simon. With J. J. O’Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary’s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O’Connor, Wexford. With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in. With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree. With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the passtouch of secret monitor, luring him to doom. With look to look. With me all or not at all. With mixed feelings. With mother’s money order, eight shillings, the banging door of the post office slammed in your face by the usher. With my eyeglass in my ocular. With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom. With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen. Without a doubt. —Without a second word either, Mr Power said. With pathos. With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy. With quiet feeling. With ratsteeth bared he muttered:
—Coactus volui. With regret he lets the unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. With sadness. With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor’s shears. With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration. With sudden fervour. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom. With thanks. With the approval of the eminent poet, Mr Geo. With the Bannons. With thee it was not as with many that will and would and wait and never—do. —With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed. With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it but on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk. With this ring I thee own. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With turf from the midland bogs. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS
 Hynes here too: account of the funeral probably. With unmixed feeling. With wax. With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected? With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations? With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation? With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects? With what success had he attempted direct instruction? With which attendant indignities? With who? With whom? With will will we withstand, withsay. With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling mort. With your tooraloom tooraloom. Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet. Woa! Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. —Woke me up in the night, she said. Wolfe Tone. Woman. Woman. Woman. Woman. Woman and man that is. Womanbody after going on the straw? Woman dying to. Woman, it’s breaking me! Woman’s hand. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Woman’s reason. Woman’s woe with wonder pondering. Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man’s lingam. Womb? Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. Womb of sin. Women. Women all for caste till you touch the spot. Women buzz round it like flies round treacle. Women enjoy it. Women especially are so touchy. Women faint. Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters’ wives. Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom’s robe. Women run him. Women too. Women too. Women whisper eagerly. Women will pay a lot of heed, I don’t think. Women won’t pick up pins. Won a bit on the races. Wonder. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would. Wonder did she wrote it herself. Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down. Wonderful. Wonderful entirely. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them? Wonderful inspiration! Wonderful liar. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she’s on for it: good evening. Wonderful organisation certainly, goes like clockwork. Wonderful really. Wonder have I time for a bath this morning. Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl. Wonder how he looks at life. Wonder how is she feeling in that region. Wonder how it first struck him. Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee. Wonder if he has a name. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. Wonder if he’s too far to. Wonder if I’ll meet him today. Wonder if it’s bad to go with them then. Wonder if she pronounces that right: voglio. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla. Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his? Wonder is he pimping after me? Wonder is it like that. Wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after. Wonder is nurse Callan there still. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin’s parade. Wonder is that young Dedalus the moving spirit. Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he. Wonder what. Wonder what he does. Wonder what her father gave for it. —Wonder what he’s buying, M’Coy said, glancing behind. Wonder what he was eating. Wonder what I look like to her. Wonder what kind is swanmeat. Wonder where he lives. Wonder where it is really. Wonder where that rat is by now. Wonder who’s playing. Wonder who was that chap at the grave in the brown macin. Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Wonder why they come out at night like mice. Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight. Wonderworker. Wonder would he feel it if something was removed. Won’t last. Won’t look. Won’t sleep, though. Won’t that be nice? Won’t wash here for nuts nohow. Won’t you come to Sandymount,
     Madeline the mare? Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed. Woods his name is. Woodwind like Goodwin’s name. Woodwinds mooing cows. Word known to all men. Words? Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger. Wore out his wife: now sings. Wore the breeches. Workbasket I could buy for Molly’s birthday. Work Hynes and Crawford. Work in all you know. Working away, tearing away. Working overtime but her luck’s turned today. Working tooth and jaw. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. World’s biggest balloon. World without end. Worse, worse! Worst is beginning. Worst man in Dublin. Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about? Would he understand? Would I like her in pyjamas? —Would I make any money by it? Would it make a very great difference? —Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said. Wouldn’t be surprised. Wouldn’t care if I was stretched out stiff. Wouldn’t eat her cakes or speak or look. Wouldn’t give that satisfaction. Wouldn’t have it of course because he didn’t think of it himself first. Wouldn’t it be more decent than galloping two abreast? Wouldn’t know which to believe. Wouldn’t lend each other a pinch of salt. Wouldn’t let them within the bawl of an ass. Wouldn’t live in it if they paid me. Wouldn’t mind being a waiter in a swell hotel. Wouldn’t trouble only I was expecting some money. Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand? Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear? Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! Would you? Would you do what he did? Would you go back to then? Would you like a bite of something? Would you like a cup, ma’am? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second? —Would you like the window open a little? Would you like to see a priest? Would you mind, please, telling me the right time? Would you or would you not? Would you suck a lemon? Wow! Wow, my tootsies! Wow wow wow. Wrangle with Molly it was put me off. Wreckers.

 Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they
 theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods Ave Maria what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket O Maria Santisima he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the Stabat Mater by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all Ill be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were
 yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7 wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday

pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their 3 Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other

regards to your father also Captain Grove with love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after when I put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a notion what I meant arent they thick never understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when I half frowned at him outside Westland row chapel

than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam only his letter

Yes, must. —Yes, my love? —Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife’s brother. Yes now, look at it that way. —Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Yes: one, seven, six. Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence. Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors Bandez! Yes, quite true. —Yes, Red Murray agreed. Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults. —Yes, says Alf. —Yes, says Alf. —Yes, says Bloom. —Yes, says Bloom. —Yes, says J. J., and every male that’s born they think it may be their Messiah. —Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law. —Yes, says J. J. He’ll square that, Ned, says he. —Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective. Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T. C. D. because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be. —Yes, she said. Yes, she was back. —Yes, sir. —Yes, sir. —Yes, sir. —Yes, sir. —Yes, sir. Yes, sir. —Yes, sir? Yes, sir. —Yes, sir. —Yes, sir. —Yes, sir. —Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. —Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. —Yes, sir, says he. —Yes, sir, says Terry. —Yes, sir, she said. —Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate. —Yes, sir, the blond girl said. —Yes, sir, the chemist said. —Yes, sir, the chemist said. Yes, some spinach. —Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that. Yes, Telegraph... —Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday. Yes, that. —Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less. —Yes, that’s the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them. —Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Yes, there it, yes. Yes, there’s the light in the priest’s house. —Yes, the stripling answered. Yes: they were from Belvedere. —Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Yes: under the bridge. Yes, used to carry punched tickets to prove an alibi if they arrested you for murder somewhere. Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her. Yes, we will not. —Yes, what is it? Yes, yes. Yes, yes. —Yes, yes. Yes, yes. Yes, yes: a woman too. —Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. —Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Yes, yes, will tell you. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. —Yes, your worship. Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine. Yet Eve and the serpent contradicts. Yet here’s a spot. Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time. Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Yet I’ve a sort of a
     Yorkshire relish for
     My little Yorkshire rose. Yet more Bloom stretched his string. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel. Yet that man’s father was his grandfather’s son. Yet they do. Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal. Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remaining what he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing, off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched, inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on. Yet too much happy bores. Yet who knows after. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Y. M. C. A. Eating with a stopwatch, thirtytwo chews to the minute. Yo. Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside. Yook. Yooka. You? You. You abominable person! You and I are the fat in the fire. You and me, don’t you know: in the same boat. —You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You are a necessary evil. You are a perfect stranger. You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. You are cautioned. You are down and out and don’t you forget it, old bean. You are falling. —You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. You are mine. You are mine. You are my guests. You are my lookingglass from night to morning. You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. You are the link between nations and generations. —You are the only contributor to Dana who asks for pieces of silver. You are walking through it howsomever. You are your own master, it seems to me. You, Armstrong. —You, Armstrong, Stephen said. —You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul. You ask for Carr. You bad man! You beast! —You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought. You bitch’s bast. You bloody old Roman empire? You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly, striking face. You call it a festivity. You call me up by sunphone any old time. You can almost taste it, can’t you? You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times. You can do it. “YOU CAN DO IT!”
 The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen’s shoulder. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends. —You can keep it, Mr Bloom said. You can make bacon of that. You cannot eat your cake and have it. You can pay all together, sir, when you come back. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. You can’t. You can take it from here or from here. You can’t drink that stuff. —You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts. You can’t lick ’em. [ 2 ]
—You, Cochrane, what city sent for him? You coming long? You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did. You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco. —You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said. You could hear them in Paris and New York. You could see there was a story behind it. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way. —You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward. You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette’s. You daren’t budge. —You did, averred Ben Dollard. You did that. You die for your country. You don’t? —You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom. You don’t know yet what money is. You don’t say so? You don’t stand for that, I suppose? You don’t want a scandal. You down here in the haunts of sin! You fee mendancers on the Riviera, I read. You fenians forget some things. You find my words dark. You flew. You found me in evil company, highkickers, coster picnicmakers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in fleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of £. s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. You funny ass, you! You got me? —You got more than that, father, Dilly said. —You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes. —You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form. You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. You had enough. You had to come back. You had to laugh at her sometimes. You have a car?... You have broken the spell. You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a polity. You have earned it. You have eaten all we left. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. You have heard of von Blum Pasha. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. You have no... You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe. You have nothing? You have said it. You have some. You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said. You have that something within, the higher self. You have the advantage of me. You have two copies there. You hear? You hear? You heard him say he was going to Clare. You hit him without provocation. You horrid thing! You hurt? You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1886 to square the circle and win that million. You just buy one of these machines. You just shove in my name if I’m not there, will you? —You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. You kept them for the last, didn’t you? You know, councillor, the Manx parliament. You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner. You know Holohan? You know Hoppy? You know how. You know how difficult it is. You know how he made his mark? You know I had a soft corner for you. You know Jem Mullins? You know Manningham’s story of the burgher’s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in Richard III and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon’s blankets: William the conqueror came before Richard III. You know me. —You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length. You know that old joke, rose of Castile. You know that one? You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily? You know the usual. You know why? —You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. You larn that go off of they there Frenchy bilks? —You like it? You little expected me but I’ve come to stay and make a fresh start. You little know what’s in store for you. You’ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me. You’ll be home the night! You’ll be soon over it. You’ll be taught the error of your ways. You’ll find them very handy. You’ll get curvature of the spine. You’ll get into trouble. You’ll look spiffing in them. You’ll meet with a... You’ll need to rise precious early, you sinner there, if you want to diddle the Almighty God. You’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it. You look as though you had done the deed. You look damn well when you’re dressed. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner. You look like communards. You love a certain person. —You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. You may. You may have heard perhaps. You may mention my name. You mean that I... You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick? You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand? You might go farther and fare worse. You might pick up a young widow here. You might put down my name at the funeral, will you? You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there. You move a motion? You must. You must believe. You must have a certain fascination: Parnell. —You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. —You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way. You must read them in the original. You must take the will for the deed. You naughtn’t to look, missus, so you naughtn’t when a lady’s ashowing of her elemental. You naughty too? You needn’t try to hide, I says to him. You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. You never saw the like of it in all your born puff. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. Young! Young! Young. Young Colum and Starkey. Younger than I am. Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer’s office, Dublin Castle. Young kisses: the first. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms. Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it. Young student. Young student. Young student. Young woman. Young woman enters. You not come? You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself. You ought to eat. You ought to eat more solid food. You ought to make it a dialogue, don’t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote. You ought to see yourself! You owe it. You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons. —You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street. —You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. You punish me? Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! Your attention! —Your beau, is it? Your boy’s thinking of you. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Your classic curves, beautiful immortal, I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray. Your corporosity sagaciating O K? How’s the squaws and papooses? Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman. You’re after hitting me. You’re a rogue and I’m another. You’re a witness. You’re blinder nor I am, you bitch’s bastard! You’re darned witty. You’re dreaming. You’re hot! —You’re in black, I see. —You’re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. You’re in for it this time! You’re like someone I knew once. You’re like the rest of them, are you? —You’re looking extra. —You’re looking rubicund, George Lidwell said. You’re looking splendid. You’re looking splendid. You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. You remember the Childs fratricide case. —You’re not a believer, are you? You’re not game, in fact. You’re not his father, are you? —You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. Your epitaph is written. You’re right, by God. —You’re right there, Nosey Flynn said. You’re scalding! You’re such a slyboots, old cocky. You’re sure? —You’re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said. You’re the warrior. You’re too beastly awfully weird for words! —You’re very funny, Dilly said, grinning. You’re very simple, I don’t think. —You’re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Your eyes are as vapid as the glasseyes of your stuffed fox. You’re your father’s son. Your fly is open, mister! —Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell. Your funeral’s tomorrow
     While you’re coming through the rye. Your God. Your God was a jew. Your god was a jew. Your governor is just gone. —Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing. Your head it simply. Your head it simply swirls. Your head it simply swurls. Your head it simply swurls. Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies? Your heart you sing of. Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom. Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union. Your name on the altarlist. Your own? Your own name is strange enough. Your postprandial, do you know that word? Your reasons, pray? Yours? Yours for the asking. —Your son and heir. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Your starving eyes and allbeplastered neck you stole my heart, O gluepot. Your strength our weakness. Your terrible loss. Your wife and my wife. —You said, Stephen answered, O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead. You sang that song to me. You saved men from drowning. —You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm. You saw only your mother die. You say right, sir. —You? says Joe. You see? You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy. You see he’s incapable. You see if you can get it into your two papers. You seem to have enjoyed yourself. —You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey. You see the idea is to tour the chief towns. You shall find that these night insects follow the light. You should have seen long John’s eye. —You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. You simply don’t knock against those kind of women here. You, sir? Yous join uz, dear sir? You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson’s bed, clergyman’s daughter. —You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice called Ireland for short. —You take my breath away. Youth. —You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said. You think the ladies love you! Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety. You told the Clongowes gentry you had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. You too. You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man’s part. You’ve a hard chancre. You wanted to. You watch them chaps. You were a lucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at you directly you got back. You were always a favourite with the ladies. You were and a bloody sight better. You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade about to be violated by lieutenant Smythe-Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell M. P., signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henri Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Croesus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. You were a student, weren’t you? You were awfully holy, weren’t you? You were going to do wonders, what? —You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water. You were never here before, Jack, were you? You were not born to be a teacher, I think. —You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he asked of Stephen. You what? —You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. You whatwhat? You which? You who hear in peace. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with whalebone busk to the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. You will dance attendance or I’ll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You will fall. You will not be master of others or their slave. —You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays. You will see. You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. You will see my ghost after death. You will see who. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders. You won’t get a virgin in the flash houses. You would feel a different man. You would give your five wits for youth’s proud livery he pranks in. You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer. You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick. You wouldn’t do a less thing. You wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. You wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d’aisance. Yrfmstbyes. Yum. Yummyyum, Womwom! Yumyum. Yup, sartin I do. —Zinfandel is it? Zinfandel’s the favourite, Lord Howard de Walden’s, won at Epsom. Zoe! Zoe! Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. ZOE AND FLORRY: Laugh together. Zoe and Kitty still point right. ZOE: And more’s mother? Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. ZOE: And you know what thought did? ZOE: Are you looking for someone? ZOE: Babby! ZOE: Before you’re twice married and once a widower. Zoe bends over the table. ZOE: Briskly. ZOE: Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil. ZOE: Clap on the back for Zoe. ZOE: Do as you’re bid. ZOE: Examining Stephen’s palm. ZOE: Explodes in laughter. ZOE: Fanning herself with the grate fan. ZOE-FANNY: I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it. ZOE: Flattered. ZOE: Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing. ZOE: For Zoe? ZOE: Gaily. ZOE:

     God’ll ask you where is that
     You’ll say you don’t know
     God’ll send you down below. ZOE: Glibly. ZOE: Go abroad and love a foreign lady. ZOE: Go on. ZOE: Here. ZOE: Her head perched aside in mock pride. ZOE: Her lucky hand instantly saving him. Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him. ZOE: Holds up her hand. ZOE: How’s the nuts? ZOE: I feel it. ZOE: I’m giddy! ZOE: In sudden alarm. ZOE: In sudden sulks. ZOE: In the doorway. ZOE: I see, says the blind man. ZOE: Is he hungry? ZOE: It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him. ZOE: Ladies first, gentlemen after. ZOE: Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking. ZOE: Lightly. ZOE: Me. ZOE: More limelight, Charley. ZOE: Mount of the moon. Zoe mou sas agapo. ZOE: Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater. ZOE: No, eightyone. Zoe offers him chocolate. ZOE: Peering at Bloom’s palm. ZOE: Pointing. ZOE: Points. ZOE: Promptly. ZOE: Pulling at Florry. ZOE: Quickly. ZOE: Runs to stephen and links him. Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle. ZOE: Silent means consent. ZOE: Sniffs his hair briskly. ZOE: Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils. ZOE: Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet. ZOE: Talk away till you’re black in the face. ZOE: Tears open the silverfoil. ZOE: That’s me. ZOE: The devil is in that door. ZOE: There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. ZOE: Thursday’s child has far to go. ZOE: To Florry. ZOE: Tragically. ZOE: Turns. ZOE: Turns the drumhandle. ZOE: Twirling, her hand to her brow. ZOE: Twirls round herself, heeltapping. ZOE: What day were you born? Zoe whispers to Florry. Zoe whispers to her. ZOE: Who has a fag as I’m here? ZOE: Widening her slip to screen her. ZOE: Yes. ZOE:
 Yorkshire through and through. ZOE: You both in black. ZOE: You’ll know me the next time. Zoo. Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads. Zut!
